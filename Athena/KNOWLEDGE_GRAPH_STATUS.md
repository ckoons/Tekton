# Athena Knowledge Graph - Current Status

## âœ… What's Working

### Core Functionality
- **Persistence**: Knowledge graph saves/loads from `.tekton/data/athena/`
- **Sync**: Unix-style sync() pattern implemented - batch writes, explicit sync
- **Ingestion**: Successfully loaded 71 entities, 60 relationships
- **API**: All endpoints working (with corrected paths)
- **Search**: Fixed after restart - properties handling both simple and structured formats

### Data Loaded
- **10 Components**: Athena, Budget, Engram, Ergon, Hermes, Metis, Rhetor, Sophia, Synthesis, shared
- **61 Landmarks** broken down by type:
  - 22 architectural decisions
  - 12 state checkpoints  
  - 9 danger zones
  - 9 performance boundaries
  - 8 integration points
  - 1 API contract

### Integration Points Discovered
- Rhetor â†’ Hermes (WebSocket/REST)
- Rhetor â†’ Anthropic API
- Athena â†’ Neo4j (when available)
- Hermes â†’ All components (pub/sub)
- Budget â†’ BudgetEngine
- shared â†’ All components (utilities)

## ðŸ”§ Known Issues

### Minor
- Entity search works but test suite needs endpoint path update
- Discovery endpoint lists wrong paths (double prefix remnant)
- MCP Bridge warning on startup (non-critical)

### API Endpoints (Corrected)
```bash
# Stats
GET /api/v1/knowledge/stats

# Entities (note the double prefix - should be fixed)
GET/POST /api/v1/entities/entities

# Relationships  
POST /api/v1/knowledge/relationships

# Sync
POST /api/v1/knowledge/sync
```

## ðŸ“Š Query Examples

```python
# Find all architectural decisions
GET /api/v1/entities/entities?limit=100
# Then filter by entityType == 'landmark_architecture_decision'

# Search for a component
GET /api/v1/entities/entities?query=Hermes

# Get component relationships
GET /api/v1/knowledge/entities/{entity_id}/relationships

# Find paths between components
GET /api/v1/knowledge/path?source_id={id1}&target_id={id2}
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Fix entities router** - Remove double prefix like we did for knowledge router
2. **Add visualization endpoints** - Graph layout algorithms for UI
3. **Implement graph analysis** - Centrality, clustering, dependency analysis
4. **Add real-time updates** - WebSocket feed of graph changes
5. **Query language** - Cypher-like queries for complex analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

The knowledge graph reveals Tekton's architecture:
- Strong separation of concerns (10 distinct components)
- Hermes as central message hub (most relationships)
- Shared utilities used across all components
- Clear integration boundaries defined by landmarks
- 22 architectural decisions documented in code

Casey's router-less networking principle applies here too - the knowledge flows directly between components through well-defined integration points, no central routing needed.
