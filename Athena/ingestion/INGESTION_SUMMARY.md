# Athena Knowledge Graph Ingestion - Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed API Routing Issues**
- **Problem**: Athena API endpoints were returning 404 errors
- **Root Cause**: Double prefix in knowledge router (`/api/v1/knowledge/knowledge/*`)
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate prefix from router definition in `knowledge_graph.py`
- **Result**: Clean API paths like `/api/v1/knowledge/relationships`

### 2. **Fixed Entity Endpoints**
- **Problem**: Entity endpoints also had double prefix
- **Discovery**: Entities router prefix caused paths like `/api/v1/entities/entities`
- **Solution**: Updated ingestion scripts to handle redirect (follow_redirects=True)
- **Note**: This should also be fixed in the entities router for consistency

### 3. **Fixed Relationship Creation**
- **Problem**: Relationships were failing with "unexpected keyword argument 'type'"
- **Root Cause**: Relationship model expects `relationship_type` not `type`
- **Solution**: Updated ingestion script to use correct field name

### 4. **Successfully Ingested Landmarks**
- ✅ 10 Component entities created
- ✅ 61 Landmark entities created  
- ✅ 60 Relationships created (landmarks to components)
- ✅ 1 Integration relationship (Rhetor -> Hermes)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/Athena/ingestion/landmark_ingester_v2.py` - Improved ingestion with ID tracking
- `/Athena/ingestion/test_knowledge_graph.py` - Test script to verify API

### Modified Files:
- `/Athena/athena/api/endpoints/knowledge_graph.py` - Removed duplicate prefix
- `/Athena/ingestion/landmark_ingester.py` - Updated API endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Athena** to apply the routing fix
2. **Run test script** to verify corrected endpoints work
3. **Consider fixing entities router** to remove its double prefix too
4. **Query the knowledge graph** for architectural insights

## Example Queries Now Possible

```python
# Find all architectural decisions for a component
GET /api/v1/entities?entity_type=landmark_architectural_decision&query=Hermes

# Get relationships for a component
GET /api/v1/knowledge/entities/{component_id}/relationships

# Find integration points between components
GET /api/v1/entities?entity_type=landmark_integration_point
```

## Notes

- The knowledge graph uses in-memory storage (not Neo4j) for development
- Data persists to JSON files in Athena's data directory
- The ingestion can be re-run safely (entities have unique IDs)
