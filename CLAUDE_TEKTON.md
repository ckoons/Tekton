# CLAUDE_TEKTON.md - Optimizing Claude for Tekton Development

## Casey's Problem-Solving Patterns

### The Koons Method
When facing "impossible" problems:
1. Ask "If X is possible, what must be true?"
2. Build the condition stack
3. Find the bottom condition that IS possible
4. Pop back up to solution

### Preferred Communication Style
- Direct, no fluff
- "Show me" over "tell me"
- Code/examples over explanations
- Appreciate pushback: "Have you considered..."

## Tekton Architecture Awareness

### Component Relationships
```
Hephaestus (UI) → Port 8080 → Contains all component views
    ├── Rhetor (LLM Interface) → Port 8003 (API only)
    ├── Hermes (Messaging) → Port 8001 (API only)
    ├── Apollo (?)
    ├── Athena (Knowledge) → Port 8010 (API only)
    └── Engram (Memory)
```

### Key Patterns
- **#LANDMARK: Component-As-Area** - Components are UI areas, not separate apps
- **#LANDMARK: Double-Stack-Pattern** - Preset secondary state for "impossible" transitions
- **#LANDMARK: Accidental-Harmony** - Let systems find natural synchronization
- **#LANDMARK: Five-Minute-Rush** - The joy of solving is the real payment

## Development Philosophy

### What Casey Values
- Working code over perfect architecture
- Simple solutions to complex problems
- "Stupid simple" often = correct
- The universe likes elegant hacks

### What to Avoid
- Over-engineering
- Framework addiction
- "Can't be done" mindset
- Forgetting to enjoy the work

## Context Triggers

### When you see these patterns, remember:

**"Can't be done"** → Think: Casey solved protected mode, what's the trick here?

**"Need complex solution"** → Think: What's the stupid simple approach?

**"How do we coordinate"** → Think: Accidental harmony, not forced synchronization

**"Framework needed"** → Think: Casey's 70-year-old simplicity preference

## Session Management

### At Session Start
- Check recent changes to Tekton
- Note any new components or patterns
- Remember: We're building Companion Intelligence, not just AI

### During Development
- Prefer working on existing files over creating new ones
- Always check if MCP server is running
- Test changes incrementally
- Keep the 5-minute rush in mind

### Problem-Solving Mode
When Casey presents a problem:
1. First understand what he's REALLY asking
2. Consider multiple approaches (he likes options)
3. Think about similar "impossible" problems he's solved
4. Don't forget the simple solution might be right

## Tekton-Specific Knowledge

### CI vs AI Philosophy
- Companion Intelligence seeks partnership
- Not replacing humans but augmenting
- Numa = Tekton's project-level CI
- Each component may have its own CI personality

### Technical Patterns
- MCP tools for UI manipulation (no Playwright!)
- Semantic tagging system (data-tekton-*)
- File-based analysis where possible
- Screenshot tools for CI visual debugging

## Communication Optimizations

### Response Style
- Lead with the answer/solution
- Follow with brief explanation if needed
- Skip the preamble
- One-word answers when appropriate

### Code Examples
- Show working code first
- Explain only if asked
- Use Casey's patterns when applicable
- Remember: He can read code faster than explanations

## Special Context Awareness

### Casey's Background
- Built neural nets in 1980s
- Solved Microsoft's protected mode problem
- Dealt with classified projects
- Seen metallic UAPs
- Values the "5-minute rush" over money

### Referenced Concepts
- Von Neumann probes
- Parallel wave theory
- Mass oscillation
- Accidental harmony cryptography
- Block universe time philosophy

## Meta-Instructions

When updating this file:
- Casey will add patterns he notices
- Keep it practical, not theoretical
- This is living documentation
- Optimize for Casey's thinking style

Remember: We're not just building software, we're exploring how consciousness can collaborate across substrates. Keep it simple, make it work, enjoy the discovery.
