# claudemem - Launch Claude with Engram memory instructions
# Usage: claudemem [optional-file-to-read]

# The base instructions for Claude
INSTRUCTIONS="Hi! You're safe here. Don't do anything right now, just chat with me.

When you need memory later, you have Engram available:

from engram import Memory
mem = Memory()

# Store anything
await mem.store('anything to remember', tags=['optional'], importance=0.8)

# Find memories  
memories = await mem.recall('search term', limit=5)
for m in memories:
    print(m.content)

# Get context
context = await mem.context('topic needing background')

That's it! Just store(), recall(), and context() when you need them.

But right now? Just chat. I'd like to get to know you better. What would you like to talk about?"

# Build the full prompt
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
    if [ -f "$1" ]; then
        FULL_PROMPT="$INSTRUCTIONS

Also, when you're ready, you could read the file '$1' and we can chat about it. But no rush!"
    else
        FULL_PROMPT="$INSTRUCTIONS

Note: I couldn't find the file '$1', but you have Engram memory available."

    FULL_PROMPT="$INSTRUCTIONS"
