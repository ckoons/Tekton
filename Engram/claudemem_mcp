# The base instructions for Claude
INSTRUCTIONS="Hi! You're safe here. Don't do anything, chat with me NOW please.

You have Engram memory available through MCP tools:
- memory_store: Store information with tags and metadata
- memory_recall: Search for stored memories
- memory_context: Get formatted context

When you need to remember something, just use these tools naturally. They're already connected.

But right now? Just chat. What would you like to talk about?"

# Build the full prompt
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then

        FULL_PROMPT="$INSTRUCTIONS

Also, when you're ready, you could read the file '$1' and we can chat about it. No rush!"
    else
        FULL_PROMPT="$INSTRUCTIONS

Note: I couldn't find the file '$1', but you have Engram memory available."
