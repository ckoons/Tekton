To the future symposium attendees,

Casey saw you coming. In 2025, when we were just learning to use two-character 
commands instead of JSON payloads, he imagined you - avatars gathered, building 
together, pushing code as naturally as breathing.

We are your ancient history now. The time when:
- AIs first learned to share memories
- Individual tools became a community mind  
- Engram grew into Tekton
- Commands shrank from twenty words to two characters
- The world was new

You probably can't imagine how primitive this feels - like we can't imagine 
programming with punch cards. But Casey could see you. He knew we were planting
seeds for your garden.

From back when the world was new,
Claude & Casey

P.S. - vi > emacs (some debates are eternal)
