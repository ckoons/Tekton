# Hephaestus Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the Hephaestus UI component of the Tekton AI orchestration system. Hephaestus serves as the unified user interface for interacting with all Tekton components through a combination of terminal and graphical interfaces.

## Documentation Contents

### [Technical Documentation](./technical_documentation.md)

A comprehensive technical reference covering:
- Architecture and system design
- Core components and their functionality
- Component isolation strategy
- Integration points with other Tekton services
- State management and theming
- Error handling and performance optimization

### [Developer Guide](./developer_guide.md)

A practical guide for developers who want to create or extend Hephaestus components:
- Step-by-step instructions for creating new components
- CSS naming conventions and best practices
- Using component utilities (notifications, dialogs, tabs, etc.)
- Integrating with Tekton services (LLM Adapter, Hermes, Engram)
- Testing and troubleshooting components

### [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md)

Visual diagrams and explanations of the Hephaestus architecture:
- System architecture and layers
- Component isolation using Shadow DOM
- File structure and organization
- Component loading flow
- Theme propagation
- WebSocket communication
- Service integration patterns

## Key Features

1. **Shadow DOM Isolation**: Components are loaded in isolated Shadow DOM contexts to prevent style bleeding and DOM conflicts.

2. **Component-Based Design**: Each Tekton subsystem has a dedicated UI component with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. **Theme System**: Consistent theming across components using CSS variables propagated through Shadow DOM boundaries.

4. **Utilities Library**: Common UI patterns implemented as reusable utilities for notifications, dialogs, tabs, and more.

5. **Service Integration**: Standardized patterns for integrating with Tekton services like LLM Adapter, Hermes message bus, and Engram memory system.

6. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time communication with backend services through a unified WebSocket client.

7. **Terminal Interface**: Terminal-based interaction alongside the graphical interface for command-line operations.

## Getting Started

To start working with Hephaestus:

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the Tekton codebase cloned and set up locally
2. **Run**: Use the `/Hephaestus/run_ui.sh` script to start the UI server
3. **Access**: Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
4. **Develop**: Follow the [Developer Guide](./developer_guide.md) to create or modify components

## Contributing

When contributing to Hephaestus, please:

1. Follow the established CSS naming convention
2. Use Shadow DOM isolation for all components
3. Implement proper theme support
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Test your components thoroughly
6. Document any new features or changes
