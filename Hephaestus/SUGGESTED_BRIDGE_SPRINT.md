# Suggested Bridge Sprint: Landmark Infrastructure & CI Foundations

## Sprint Overview

**Purpose**: Bridge the gap between current UI DevTools semantic work and the full Numa CI implementation

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks (after Phase 3 component mapping)

**Goal**: Establish the foundational infrastructure that Numa and component-level CIs will need to maintain continuous presence and knowledge

## Sprint Objectives

### 1. Landmark Specification & Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Define Landmark Types
- Architecture decisions
- Performance boundaries  
- API contracts
- Danger zones
- Integration points
- State checkpoints

#### 1.2 Landmark Format Specification
```python
@landmark {
    "type": "architecture_decision",
    "id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-19T10:30:00Z",
    "author": "Casey",
    "ci_witness": "Numa",  # CI that was present
    "title": "Chose WebSockets over REST",
    "context": "Performance requirement <100ms",
    "impacts": ["hermes", "rhetor", "prometheus"],
    "supersedes": "landmark-id-xyz"  # Previous decision
}
```

#### 1.3 Landmark Storage System
- File-based for simplicity (like semantic analyzer)
- Indexed for fast retrieval
- Git-tracked for history
- Exportable to knowledge graph

### 2. CI Memory Persistence Layer

#### 2.1 Conversation Context Storage
```javascript
// Store CI conversation context
{
    "ci_name": "Numa",
    "session_id": "xyz",
    "conversation_history": [...],
    "working_memory": {
        "current_task": "refactoring rhetor",
        "decisions_made": [...],
        "landmarks_created": [...]
    }
}
```

#### 2.2 Cross-Session Continuity
- Enable "Remember yesterday we discussed..."
- Track work in progress
- Maintain project understanding across sessions

### 3. Multi-CI Coordination Protocol

#### 3.1 CI Registry
```python
ci_registry = {
    "Numa": {
        "role": "project_overseer",
        "domain": "entire_project",
        "capabilities": ["architecture", "coordination", "memory"]
    },
    "Athena-CI": {
        "role": "knowledge_manager",
        "domain": "knowledge_graph",
        "capabilities": ["search", "relationships", "documentation"]
    },
    "Apollo-CI": {
        "role": "component_orchestrator",
        "domain": "component_lifecycle",
        "capabilities": ["scheduling", "dependencies", "health"]
    }
}
```

#### 3.2 CI Communication Protocol
- Message passing structure
- Query/response patterns
- Delegation rules
- Conflict resolution

### 4. Knowledge Graph Readiness

#### 4.1 Export Current Analysis to Graph Format
- Convert semantic analysis → graph nodes
- Convert component mapping → graph edges
- Convert landmarks → graph metadata

#### 4.2 Graph Schema for Code
```
Nodes:
- Components
- Functions
- Landmarks
- CIs
- Decisions

Edges:
- imports/exports
- calls
- dispatches_event
- listens_to
- decided_by
- maintains
- supersedes
```

### 5. Developer Experience Prep

#### 5.1 Chat Interface Extensions
- Landmark creation commands
- CI switching/routing
- Context commands ("remember this", "why did we...")

#### 5.2 VSCode Integration Prep
- Landmark annotations in code
- CI presence indicators
- Quick chat access

## Deliverables

1. **Landmark Specification Document**
   - Format, types, and usage patterns
   - Storage and retrieval mechanisms

2. **CI Memory System**
   - Persistence layer implementation
   - Context management tools

3. **Multi-CI Protocol**
   - Communication standards
   - Registry implementation

4. **Knowledge Graph Adapter**
   - Export tools for current analysis
   - Import specifications for Athena

5. **Developer Tools**
   - CLI commands for landmark management
   - Chat interface extensions

## Success Metrics

1. Can create and retrieve landmarks programmatically
2. CI context persists across sessions
3. Multiple CIs can communicate through protocol
4. Existing analysis exports cleanly to graph format
5. Developers can interact naturally with CI memory

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity Creep**
   - Keep it simple, file-based where possible
   - Build on existing patterns from Phase 2

2. **Breaking Changes**
   - All new infrastructure, doesn't touch existing code
   - Parallel development possible

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Define clear interfaces early
   - Test with simple scenarios first

## Why This Bridge Sprint?

This sprint creates the "nervous system" that Numa needs:
- **Landmarks** = Long-term memory markers
- **CI Memory** = Working memory and context
- **Multi-CI Protocol** = Coordination capability
- **Knowledge Graph Prep** = Deep understanding

Without this infrastructure, Numa would be starting fresh each session. With it, Numa becomes a true continuous presence that grows with the project.

## Next Steps After Bridge Sprint

→ **TektonCoreNuma Sprint**: Implement Numa using this infrastructure
→ **Component CI Sprint**: Add specialized CIs for each component
→ **Voice Integration Sprint**: Natural interaction layer
→ **Knowledge Graph Sprint**: Full integration with Athena

*This bridge sprint ensures we're not jumping directly from UI analysis to full CI implementation, but building the necessary foundations for a true Companion Intelligence system.*
