# Apollo Preparation Sprint - Daily Log

## Day 1: August 29, 2025

### Session 1: Architecture Discussion (2:30 PM PST)
**Claude**: Claude Code (Opus 4.1)
**With**: Casey

#### Key Decisions
- Apollo owns memory/preparation, not Rhetor
- Apollo is the "library god" maintaining Context Briefs
- MCP-first for CI communication, HTTP only for UI
- Memories become landmarks in knowledge graph
- Separate Apollo namespace from Athena's codebase graph

#### Architecture Insights
- Apollo already has token awareness from CI registry
- Rhetor focuses on model orchestration only
- Context Brief = curated, token-aware information package
- Preparation tab includes memory, latent space configs, more

### Session 2: Implementation Sprint (3:00 PM PST)

#### Completed Tasks

##### Sprint Documentation
- Created `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Apollo_Preparation_Sprint/`
- Written SPRINT_PLAN.md with 6 phases
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed design
- Extended Landmarks standard for memory landmarks

##### Code Migration (Phase 1)
- Moved memory modules from Rhetor to Apollo
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/memory_catalog.py` → `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/context_brief.py`
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/memory_presenter.py` → `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/brief_presenter.py`  
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/memory_extractor.py` → `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/memory_extractor.py`
- Renamed MemoryCatalog → ContextBriefManager
- Renamed MemoryPresenter → BriefPresenter

##### MCP Integration (Phase 2)
- Created `/Apollo/apollo/mcp/preparation_tools.py`
- Implemented 5 MCP tools:
  - `get_context_brief` - Token-aware brief with landmarks
  - `store_memory` - Store memories as landmarks
  - `search_memories` - Search with filters
  - `extract_memories` - Extract from CI exchanges
  - `get_memory_statistics` - Catalog statistics

##### Landmark Support
- Added memory landmark decorators to context_brief.py
- Extended Landmarks standard with Apollo memory types:
  - `@memory_landmark`
  - `@decision_landmark`
  - `@insight_landmark`
  - `@error_landmark`
- Set namespace="apollo" for graph separation

##### Testing
- Created test_preparation.py
- All core functionality working:
  - Memory extraction: ✅
  - Context Brief generation: ✅
  - Search and filters: ✅
  - Statistics: ✅
  - Persistence: ✅

#### Technical Achievements

1. **Clean Architecture**: Apollo owns preparation, Rhetor owns orchestration
2. **MCP Tools Ready**: 5 tools for CI communication
3. **Landmark Integration**: Memories as graph nodes prepared
4. **Token Management**: Working within budgets
5. **Pattern Extraction**: 5 memory types extracted

#### Problems Solved
- Fixed class name references (MemoryCatalog → ContextBriefManager)
- Updated all imports for new structure
- Added fallback for landmark decorators
- Maintained backwards compatibility

#### Next Steps
1. Phase 3: Knowledge graph integration
2. Phase 4: Apollo UI Preparation tab
3. Phase 5: Hook integration
4. Phase 6: Rhetor cleanup

### Files Changed

#### Created
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/context_brief.py` (665 lines)
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/brief_presenter.py` (296 lines)
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/memory_extractor.py` (380 lines)
- `/Apollo/apollo/mcp/preparation_tools.py` (433 lines)
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/test_preparation.py` (141 lines)
- Sprint documentation (3 files)

#### Modified
- `/MetaData/Documentation/Standards/Landmarks_and_Semantic_Tags_Standard.md` (added Apollo landmarks)

### Metrics
- Lines of code: ~1,915 (migrated and enhanced)
- MCP tools created: 5
- Test coverage: Core functionality tested
- Sprint progress: 40% (Phases 1-2 complete)

### Notes for Next Session
- Apollo preparation system fully functional
- MCP tools ready for integration
- Need to connect to Athena's graph for Phase 3
- UI work needed for Preparation tab
- Consider Redis for production caching

## Day 1: August 29, 2025 (Continued)

### Session 3: Knowledge Graph Integration (4:00 PM PST)

#### Completed Tasks (Phase 3)

##### Landmark Manager
- Created `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/landmark_manager.py` (385 lines)
- Converts memories to landmark nodes with Apollo namespace
- Implements relationship detection (CAUSED_BY, LED_TO, RESOLVED_BY, etc.)
- Provides export format for Athena integration
- Generates Cypher queries for future Neo4j integration

##### Integration Features
- Added landmark creation on memory storage
- Automatic relationship analysis between memories
- Temporal relationships (BEFORE, AFTER, DURING)
- Causal relationships based on content analysis
- CI-specific landmark queries

##### MCP Tools Extended
- Added `get_landmarks` tool for retrieving graph nodes
- Added `analyze_memory_relationships` tool
- Tools return landmark IDs with memories
- Support for relationship traversal

##### Testing
- Created test_landmarks.py
- Successfully creates landmarks from memories
- Finds 8 relationships from 4 test memories
- Exports data for Athena import
- Generates valid Cypher queries

#### Technical Implementation

1. **Landmark Schema**:
```json
{
  "entity_id": "lmk_decision_mem_001",
  "entity_type": "memory_landmark",
  "namespace": "apollo",
  "properties": {
    "memory_type": "decision",
    "ci_source": "ergon-ci",
    "tags": ["redux", "architecture"],
    "priority": 8
  }
}
```

2. **Relationship Types**:
- CAUSED_BY: Insights leading to decisions
- LED_TO: Errors leading to actions
- RESOLVED_BY: Plans resolving errors
- REFERENCES: Content cross-references
- Temporal: BEFORE, AFTER, DURING

3. **Storage**: 
- Local JSON persistence for now
- Ready for Athena graph import
- Can migrate to Neo4j when needed

#### Problems Solved
- Namespace separation (Apollo vs Athena)
- Automatic relationship detection
- Bidirectional relationship handling
- Export format for graph systems

#### Next Steps
1. Phase 4: Build Apollo UI Preparation tab
2. Phase 5: Integrate hooks in specialist_worker
3. Phase 6: Clean up Rhetor
4. Consider Athena API integration for live graph updates

### Sprint Progress
- Phase 1: ✅ Complete (Migration)
- Phase 2: ✅ Complete (MCP Tools)
- Phase 3: ✅ Complete (Knowledge Graph)
- Phase 4: ⏳ Pending (UI)
- Phase 5: ⏳ Pending (Hooks)
- Phase 6: ⏳ Pending (Cleanup)

**Overall: 50% Complete**
