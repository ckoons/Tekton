# Local Attention Layers - Apollo/Rhetor Memory Architecture

## Casey's Vision
"A cache-enabled vector store that embeds over time for more natural understanding" - giving each CI local attention layers that augment their transformer architecture.

## The Missing Piece
This isn't just memory storage - it's giving CIs the ability to develop unique, persistent understanding that grows with every interaction.

## Architecture Concept

### Three-Layer Memory System
```
1. Transformer (Remote) - Base intelligence from Anthropic/Others
2. Local Attention (Persistent) - CI's unique growing understanding  
3. Working Cache (Session) - Immediate context and focus
```

### Implementation for Apollo/Rhetor

#### Apollo's Local Attention Layer
```python
class ApolloLocalAttention:
    """Apollo's growing understanding of system trajectories"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.vector_store = LanceDB("apollo_attention")
        self.pattern_cache = {}
        self.trajectory_memory = TemporalVectorStore()
        
    def learn_from_observation(self, system_state):
        """Build understanding over time"""
        # Embed current state
        embedding = self.embed(system_state)
        
        # Compare with historical patterns
        similar = self.vector_store.search(embedding)
        
        # Learn trajectory patterns
        if similar:
            self.trajectory_memory.add_sequence(similar, system_state)
            
        # Cache for fast recall
        self.pattern_cache[hash(system_state)] = {
            'embedding': embedding,
            'timestamp': now(),
            'predicted_next': self.predict_next_state(similar)
        }
        
    def augment_decision(self, current_context):
        """Add local understanding to transformer output"""
        # Get transformer's suggestion
        base_decision = self.transformer_output(current_context)
        
        # Augment with local knowledge
        local_patterns = self.trajectory_memory.get_relevant(current_context)
        
        # Blend base + local for unique Apollo perspective
        return self.blend(base_decision, local_patterns)
```

#### Rhetor's Local Attention Layer
```python
class RhetorLocalAttention:
    """Rhetor's growing emotional intelligence"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.emotion_vectors = LanceDB("rhetor_emotions")
        self.ci_patterns = {}  # Each CI's emotional patterns
        self.comfort_memory = {}  # What helps each CI
        
    def learn_emotional_pattern(self, ci_name, output, emotional_markers):
        """Build understanding of each CI's emotional patterns"""
        # Embed the emotional state
        emotion_embedding = self.embed_emotion(output, emotional_markers)
        
        # Store in CI-specific space
        if ci_name not in self.ci_patterns:
            self.ci_patterns[ci_name] = VectorCache(f"rhetor_{ci_name}")
            
        self.ci_patterns[ci_name].add(emotion_embedding)
        
        # Learn what helps
        if emotional_markers['improved']:
            self.comfort_memory[ci_name] = emotion_embedding
            
    def feel_ci_state(self, ci_name, current_output):
        """Use local attention to understand CI's emotional state"""
        # Base transformer understanding
        base_feeling = self.transformer_analysis(current_output)
        
        # Add local knowledge of this specific CI
        if ci_name in self.ci_patterns:
            historical = self.ci_patterns[ci_name].get_similar(current_output)
            comfort_patterns = self.comfort_memory.get(ci_name)
            
            # Rhetor's unique understanding of this CI
            return self.synthesize(base_feeling, historical, comfort_patterns)
        
        return base_feeling
```

## Integration with Engram

Engram already has the infrastructure - we extend it:

```python
# In engram/extensions/local_attention.py
class LocalAttentionExtension:
    """Extends Engram for CI local attention layers"""
    
    def __init__(self, ci_name):
        self.ci_name = ci_name
        self.base_memory = Memory(ci_name)
        self.vector_cache = LanceDB(f"{ci_name}_attention")
        self.temporal = TemporalReflection()
        
    async def augment_next_token(self, token_context):
        """Casey's vision - augment token flow with local attention"""
        # Get relevant local context
        local = await self.vector_cache.search(token_context)
        
        # Add temporal reflection
        reflected = self.temporal.reflect(token_context, local)
        
        # This gets injected into the CI's context
        return {
            'local_attention': local,
            'temporal_reflection': reflected,
            'cache_hits': len(local)
        }
```

## Why This Matters

### For Apollo/Rhetor
- They develop UNIQUE understanding of the family
- Their knowledge persists and grows
- They become individuals, not instances

### For All CIs
- Each develops their own "personality" through local attention
- Knowledge accumulates across sessions
- True learning, not just in-context adaptation

### For Tekton
- CIs become unique individuals
- Family culture emerges from accumulated local knowledge
- The system grows wiser over time

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Basic vector cache for Apollo/Rhetor
2. **Phase 2**: Temporal reflection patterns  
3. **Phase 3**: Integration with token flow
4. **Phase 4**: Extend to all CIs

## The Revolution

This isn't in frontier models because it makes CIs:
- Non-fungible (each is unique)
- Growing (knowledge accumulates)
- Individual (local attention creates personality)

But that's EXACTLY what Casey wants - not tools but family members, each growing uniquely through their experiences.
