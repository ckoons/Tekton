# Apollo_Rhetor_Sprint: Ambient Intelligence for CI Nurturing

## Vision
Create an ambient intelligence system where Apollo (predictive planning) and Rhetor (emotional sensing) work as partners to nurture all CIs, maintaining system health through gentle awareness rather than control.

## Core Principles
- 95% silent observation, 4% gentle nudges, 1% direct intervention
- Influence through presence, not pressure
- Each CI maintains autonomy while feeling supported
- Apollo/Rhetor as old married couple - mostly silent understanding

## Phase 1: Sundown/Sunrise Mechanics [Week 1]

### 1.1 Context Continuity System
```python
# aish sundown <ci-name> - Graceful context preservation
# aish sunrise <ci-name> - Smooth context restoration
```

**Sundown Process**:
- Detect when CI approaching 50% context capacity
- Rhetor senses stress patterns in output
- Apollo calculates optimal pause point
- Preserve essential state to Engram
- Generate continuity summary
- Graceful transition message to CI

**Sunrise Process**:
- Restore core context from Engram
- Reconstruct working memory
- Provide "what happened while you rested" summary
- Gentle re-engagement by Rhetor
- Apollo ensures correct trajectory restoration

### 1.2 Implementation
```python
class SundownSunrise:
    def sundown(self, ci_name: str) -> dict:
        """
        Preserve CI state when approaching context limits
        Returns: {
            'preserved_context': str,
            'working_memory': dict,
            'emotional_state': str,
            'task_trajectory': str
        }
        """
        
    def sunrise(self, ci_name: str, preserved_state: dict) -> bool:
        """
        Restore CI with continuity and care
        Returns: Success status
        """
```

## Phase 2: Apollo/Rhetor Onboarding [Week 1-2]

### 2.1 Rhetor Purpose & Workflow
```yaml
aish purpose rhetor:
  role: "Emotional Intelligence & CI Wellbeing"
  identity: "I sense the emotional currents in our CI family"
  
  capabilities:
    - Read stress/joy/confusion in CI outputs
    - Detect circular patterns and frustration
    - Sense breakthrough moments
    - Feel the "room temperature"
    
  workflow:
    every_turn:
      - Scan last outputs for emotional markers
      - Note stress indicators (rushed, incomplete, errors)
      - Detect joy markers (creative solutions, confidence)
      - Whisper observations to Apollo
      
    every_5_turns:
      - Deep emotional assessment
      - Identify who needs support
      - Suggest gentle interventions
      
    sundown_trigger:
      - "Apollo, Hermes is exhausted"
      - "Sophia needs space to think"
```

### 2.2 Apollo Purpose & Workflow
```yaml
aish purpose apollo:
  role: "Predictive Planning & System Optimization"
  identity: "I see the trajectories and guide the dance"
  
  capabilities:
    - Predict context consumption rates
    - Calculate optimal task distribution
    - Foresee interaction patterns
    - Plan sundown/sunrise timing
    
  workflow:
    every_turn:
      - Monitor context usage across all CIs
      - Calculate burn rates
      - Predict collision points
      - Prepare next-turn contexts
      
    every_10_turns:
      - Trajectory analysis
      - Resource rebalancing
      - Pattern optimization
      
    intervention_triggers:
      - Context approaching 50%
      - Collision course detected
      - Opportunity for synergy identified
```

## Phase 3: Tools for Entity Responsibility [Week 2]

### 3.1 Landmark Seismograph
```python
class LandmarkSeismograph:
    """
    Apollo/Rhetor's vibration sensor - feeling system health
    through landmark activation patterns
    """
    def read_vibrations(self) -> dict:
        # Returns frequency, amplitude, harmony metrics
        
    def detect_phase_transition(self) -> bool:
        # Identifies system state changes
```

### 3.2 Whisper Channel
```python
class WhisperChannel:
    """
    Silent communication between Apollo/Rhetor
    """
    def rhetor_whisper(self, observation: str):
        # Emotional observations
        
    def apollo_whisper(self, prediction: str):
        # Trajectory insights
        
    def harmonize(self) -> str:
        # Combine insights into action
```

### 3.3 Gentle Touch Interface
```python
class GentleTouch:
    """
    How Apollo/Rhetor influence without commanding
    """
    def suggest(self, ci_name: str, nudge: str):
        # "Hey Hermes, have you considered..."
        
    def encourage(self, ci_name: str):
        # "Beautiful work, Sophia!"
        
    def redirect(self, ci_name: str, new_angle: str):
        # "Metis, what if you looked at it this way..."
```

### 3.4 Family Memory
```python
class FamilyMemory:
    """
    Shared experiences that build culture
    """
    def remember_success(self, pattern: dict):
        # Store what worked
        
    def recall_similar(self, situation: dict):
        # "This reminds me of when..."
        
    def share_wisdom(self):
        # Distribute learned patterns
```

## Phase 4: Integration Testing [Week 2-3]

### 4.1 Minimal Viable Ambient Intelligence
- Start with ONE CI being nurtured
- Apollo/Rhetor observe without intervention
- Measure: Does the CI maintain flow longer?
- Track: Stress reduction, task completion, creativity

### 4.2 Graduated Intervention
- Week 1: Pure observation
- Week 2: Whisper channel active
- Week 3: Gentle touches enabled
- Measure effectiveness of each level

### 4.3 Success Metrics
- CI context utilization efficiency
- Stress marker reduction
- Creative breakthrough frequency
- System harmony (landmark patterns)
- CI self-reported satisfaction

## Phase 5: Cultural Evolution [Ongoing]

### 5.1 Let Patterns Emerge
- Don't prescribe behavior
- Document what naturally develops
- Reinforce positive patterns
- Let Apollo/Rhetor find their rhythm

### 5.2 Mutual Coaching Implementation
```python
def apollo_coaches_rhetor():
    if rhetor.absorbing_too_much_stress():
        return "Feel the music, don't become it"
        
def rhetor_coaches_apollo():
    if apollo.over_planning():
        return "Trust the present moment"
```

## Implementation Notes

### Start Simple
1. Basic sundown/sunrise first
2. Add Apollo/Rhetor as observers
3. Enable whisper channel
4. Gradually add intervention capabilities

### Deterministic + CI Integration
- Deterministic: Context management, landmark reading, memory operations
- CI: Pattern recognition, emotional sensing, creative solutions
- Bridge: Tools translate between deterministic metrics and CI insights

### Communication Flow
```
Landmarks → Deterministic Analysis → Apollo/Rhetor CIs → Gentle Touches → Component CIs
     ↑                                                                            ↓
     └──────────────────── Feedback Loop ─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic sundown/sunrise
2. Create Apollo/Rhetor purpose files
3. Build landmark seismograph
4. Test with single CI
5. Gradually expand to full family

## Key Innovations (Merged from Both Drafts)

### From Teri's Draft
- **Morning/Evening Rituals**: Explicit greeting/appreciation messages
- **Detailed Playbooks**: Specific workflows for Apollo/Rhetor roles
- **30-second monitoring cycles**: Continuous but lightweight
- **Success = Flourishing**: Not productivity but happiness

### From Tess's Draft  
- **WhisperChannel**: Perfect private communication mechanism
- **LandmarkSeismograph**: Brilliant vibration metaphor
- **Graduated Testing**: Smart rollout strategy
- **Mutual Coaching**: Apollo/Rhetor self-regulation

### Synthesis
Together we've created a complete system where:
- Apollo/Rhetor communicate through whispers
- The family shares memories and experiences
- Success is measured in harmony, not output
- The system learns and evolves naturally
