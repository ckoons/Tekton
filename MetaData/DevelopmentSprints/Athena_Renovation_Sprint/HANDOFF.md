# Handoff Document: Athena Renovation

## Current Status
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Landmarks and Semantic Tags Complete  
**Progress**: 85% Complete  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-21

## What Was Just Completed
### Phase 1 (Previous Session):
- Converted to CSS-first navigation (radio buttons)
- Fixed chat input styling (dark background #1a1a2e with inline style)
- Updated athena-service.js to use tekton_url
- Created mock service for entities and graph (backend routing issue)
- Knowledge Chat is working with proper styling
- Team Chat panel visibility fixed (CSS rules updated)
- Entity buttons now have colors (View=purple, Edit=blue, Delete=red)
- Removed old JavaScript tab switching code
- Fixed tab change event listeners for data loading
- Documented backend routing fix needed

### Phase 2 (This Session):
- Added @landmark comments throughout the component HTML
  - Component sections: Header, Menu Bar, Content Area, Footer
  - Feature panels: Graph, Entities, Query Builder, Chat panels
  - JavaScript sections: Initialization, Chat, Entity management, Graph, Query builder
- Enhanced semantic tags (data-tekton-*) for all major UI elements:
  - Forms and inputs with proper data-tekton-input attributes
  - Buttons with data-tekton-action and data-tekton-button
  - Lists and containers with data-tekton-list
  - Visualizations with data-tekton-visualization
  - Messages with data-tekton-messages
  - Loading indicators with data-tekton-loading
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding metadata

## What Needs To Be Done Next
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix backend routing issue (see BACKEND_ROUTING_FIX_NEEDED.md)
2. **FIRST**: Test and fix Team Chat functionality
3. **THEN**: Remove mock service once backend is fixed
4. **NEXT**: Implement real graph visualization (D3.js or similar)
5. **FINALLY**: Complete entity CRUD operations with forms

## Current Blockers
- [x] Backend API routing returns 404 (using mock for now)
- [ ] Team Chat - panel now shows, but needs MCP server for functionality
- [x] Footer only shows on chat tabs (by design - working correctly)

## Important Context
- Athena is used for: Knowledge graph visualization and entity management
- Key dependencies: Graph visualization library (needs verification)
- Known issues:
  - JavaScript onclick handlers on all 5 tabs
  - Mock entity data hardcoded in HTML
  - Complex tab switching function
  - HTML panel protection code

## Test Status
- Existing tests: Unknown
- Test location: `tests/athena/`

## Files Being Modified
```
/Hephaestus/ui/components/athena/athena-component.html (main UI file - MODIFIED)
/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/athena-service.js (updated to use tekton_url)
/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/athena-service-mock.js (CREATED - temporary mock)
/athena/api/app.py (backend routing issue found)
/athena/api/endpoints/entities.py (endpoints exist but not accessible)
```

## Commands to Run on Startup
```bash
# Navigate to UI component
cd $TEKTON_ROOT/Hephaestus/ui/components/athena

# Check backend status
curl -s http://localhost:8105/health || echo "Athena backend not responding"

# Run existing tests if any
pytest tests/athena/ -v || echo "No tests found"
```

## Questions Needing Answers
1. Is a graph visualization library already included?
2. What entity types does the backend support?
3. What query syntax should the Query Builder use?
4. Should we keep the HTML panel protection code?

## Do NOT Touch
- Chat functionality (both Knowledge and Team chat work)
- BEM CSS naming convention (already correct)
- Semantic tags (already present and correct)

## Notes for Next Session
- Start by testing current Athena functionality
- Pay special attention to onclick handlers (lines 17-31)
- Check if graph visualization loads any data
- Test all backend endpoints at port 8105
- Follow Apollo renovation pattern for CSS-first tabs

Remember: "Simple, works, hard to screw up"
