# Architectural Decisions - Backend Landmarks Sprint

This document captures key architectural decisions made during the Backend Landmarks Sprint.

## Decision Log

### Decision 001: Two-Part Sprint Structure
**Date**: Sprint Planning
**Decision**: Implement as one sprint with two sequential parts
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains context between analysis and implementation
- Allows Part 1 findings to shape Part 2 design
- Reduces handoff complexity
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Two separate sprints (rejected: loss of context)
- Combined simultaneous work (rejected: implementation needs analysis first)

### Decision 002: AST-Based Analysis
**Date**: Part 1 Planning
**Decision**: Use Python AST parsing for backend analysis
**Rationale**:
- Programmatic and thorough
- Can extract patterns automatically
- Similar to DOM analysis success in UI DevTools
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual code review (rejected: too slow, inconsistent)
- Regex/text parsing (rejected: less accurate)

### Decision 003: File-Based Landmark Storage
**Date**: Part 2 Planning
**Decision**: Store landmarks in JSON files initially
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and debug
- Git-trackable for history
- No additional dependencies
- Can migrate to database later if needed
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database storage (rejected: overhead for MVP)
- In-code comments only (rejected: not queryable)

### Decision 004: Decorator-Based Instrumentation
**Date**: Part 2 Planning
**Decision**: Use Python decorators for landmark placement
**Rationale**:
- Non-invasive to existing code
- Runtime accessible
- Pythonic pattern
- Easy to add/remove
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Comments (rejected: not runtime accessible)
- Separate mapping file (rejected: harder to maintain)

### Decision 005: Component Analysis Order
**Date**: Part 1 Planning
**Decision**: Analyze core → periphery (shared → Hermes → data → AI → UI)
**Rationale**:
- Dependencies flow outward
- Understanding builds naturally
- Core patterns discovered first
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Alphabetical (rejected: ignores dependencies)
- By size (rejected: misses architectural flow)

## Landmark Type Definitions

Based on analysis needs, these landmark types were defined:

### 1. Architecture Decision
**Purpose**: Document why something was built a specific way
**Required Fields**: 
- rationale
- alternatives_considered
- impacts
- decided_by
- date

### 2. Performance Boundary  
**Purpose**: Mark performance-critical code sections
**Required Fields**:
- sla (service level agreement)
- optimization_notes
- measurement_method

### 3. API Contract
**Purpose**: Document external interfaces
**Required Fields**:
- endpoint/method
- request_schema
- response_schema
- version

### 4. Danger Zone
**Purpose**: Mark complex or risky code
**Required Fields**:
- risk_level
- mitigation_strategy
- review_requirements

### 5. Integration Point
**Purpose**: Mark where components connect
**Required Fields**:
- source_component
- target_component
- protocol
- data_flow

## CI Memory Architecture

### Decision 006: Session-Based Memory
**Date**: Part 2 Planning
**Decision**: CI memory persists per session with explicit save points
**Rationale**:
- Natural conversation flow
- Prevents memory bloat
- Clear session boundaries
**Implementation**: JSON files per CI per session

### Decision 007: Landmark-Centric Navigation
**Date**: Part 2 Planning  
**Decision**: CIs navigate codebase primarily through landmarks
**Rationale**:
- Efficient for finding decisions
- Natural for Q&A interactions
- Reduces search space
**Implementation**: Landmark search and indexing system

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Path
- Current: File-based storage works for hundreds of landmarks
- Future: May need database if exceeding 10,000 landmarks
- Migration path: Export/import tools built into v1

### Integration Points
- Designed to integrate with future Athena knowledge graph
- CLI tools can be extended for IDE integration
- API prepared for voice interaction layer

### Maintenance Strategy
- Landmarks are permanent by design
- Superseded landmarks marked but not deleted
- Annual review process recommended
