# Backend Landmarks Sprint - Completion Summary

## Sprint Overview
This sprint successfully implemented a comprehensive landmark system for the Tekton backend, providing persistent architectural memory and knowledge graph population capabilities.

## Part 1: Backend Analysis ✅
- Analyzed 465 source files across the entire Tekton codebase
- Identified 4,627 potential landmark locations
- Created AST-based analyzer with refined filtering
- Generated comprehensive analysis reports

## Part 2: Landmark System Implementation ✅

### Infrastructure Created
1. **Core Landmark System** (`/landmarks/`)
   - Base landmark types with specialized classes
   - Decorator pattern for non-invasive code marking
   - Singleton registry with indexing
   - Persistent storage system

2. **Landmark Types Implemented**
   - `@architecture_decision`: Major design choices
   - `@performance_boundary`: SLA and optimization points
   - `@api_contract`: Interface definitions
   - `@danger_zone`: High-risk code sections
   - `@integration_point`: Cross-component connections
   - `@state_checkpoint`: State management points

3. **CI Memory System**
   - NumaMemory for persistent architectural knowledge
   - Routing to specialized CIs based on queries
   - Integration with landmark search

4. **Tools and Utilities**
   - CLI tools for landmark management
   - Dashboard visualization (HTML)
   - Testing framework

### Landmarks Placed

#### Shared Utilities (7 landmarks)
- GlobalConfig: Singleton pattern, centralized configuration
- GracefulShutdown: Shutdown pattern, timeout boundaries
- StandardComponent: Lifecycle management
- MCPHelpers: FastMCP integration

#### Hermes (3+ landmarks)
- MessageBus: Pub/Sub architecture
- WebSocket endpoints: Real-time messaging
- Registration manager: Component registration

#### Apollo (2+ landmarks)
- ActionPlanner: Complex planning logic
- TokenBudget: Budget management

#### Engram (2+ landmarks)
- MemoryManager: Multi-backend architecture
- MemoryStorage: Persistence boundaries

#### Prometheus (5+ landmarks)
- PrometheusComponent: Dual-nature planning system
- PlanningEngine: Latent space reasoning
- LLMAdapter: Enhanced client integration
- CriticalPath: Graph-based analysis

#### Athena (4+ landmarks)
- AthenaComponent: Knowledge graph system
- KnowledgeEngine: Flexible adapter pattern
- QueryEngine: Multi-modal strategies
- Search/path finding: Performance boundaries

#### Rhetor (4+ landmarks)
- RhetorComponent: LLM orchestration service
- LLMClient: Multi-provider abstraction
- AISpecialistManager: Multi-agent coordination
- Messaging integration: Hermes connection

## Testing Results
- 49 landmarks registered in test environment
- All decorator patterns work without affecting code execution
- CI memory system functional with routing
- Dashboard visualization working

## Integration Status
- Landmark system fully operational
- Ready for CLI integration (`tekton landmark` commands)
- Prepared for Numa integration for persistent memory

## Next Steps
1. Continue placing landmarks in remaining components:
   - Sophia (embedding service)
   - Telos (goal management)
   - Metis (workflow orchestration)
   - Budget (cost tracking)
   - Synthesis (integration hub)
   - Harmonia (coordination)

2. Integrate with main Tekton CLI

3. Connect to Numa for persistent architectural memory

4. Expand landmark types as needed

## Key Achievement
The landmark system provides a foundation for:
- Persistent architectural knowledge across Claude sessions
- Non-invasive code documentation
- Knowledge graph population
- AI-assisted code understanding
- Cross-component relationship tracking

The system is designed to grow with Tekton, capturing institutional knowledge and architectural decisions as the codebase evolves.
