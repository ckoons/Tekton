# Backend Landmarks Sprint - Handoff Documentation

**Last Updated**: June 21, 2025
**Session Progress**: Part 1 Complete, Part 2 In Progress
**Sprint Phase**: Backend Analysis ‚úÖ ‚Üí Landmark Implementation üöß

## Summary of Work Completed

### ‚úÖ What Was Done

1. **Created AST-based Analysis Framework**
   - Built `analyze_backend.py` - comprehensive Python AST analyzer
   - Captures functions, classes, decorators, patterns, and side effects
   - Identifies landmark candidates automatically
   - Pragmatic approach focused on indexing without breaking code

2. **Analyzed Entire Tekton Backend**
   - 465 source files analyzed across 11 core components
   - 4,627 total landmarks identified
   - Properly filtered out venv, node_modules, __pycache__, tests, migrations
   - Excluded experimental/cognitive transient files

3. **Created Analysis Outputs**
   - Component-level JSON analysis files in `backend_analysis/refined/`
   - `landmark_locations.json` - Map of all landmark positions
   - `architectural_patterns.md` - Key patterns and decisions
   - Progress dashboard HTML for visualization

### üìä Key Findings

**Landmark Statistics:**
- 531 API endpoints (contracts)
- 513 high-complexity functions (danger zones)
- 197 integration points (MCP tools + WebSocket handlers)
- 1 singleton pattern instance (more exist, detection needs refinement)

**Architectural Patterns Found:**
- Async-first architecture (async/await throughout)
- Hermes as central message bus (WebSocket pub/sub)
- FastAPI for REST endpoints
- MCP for AI tool integration
- Singleton pattern for core services
- Event-driven over direct calls

## üöÄ Ready for Part 2

The analysis phase is complete. The next session can begin implementing landmarks based on the analysis.

### Key Files for Next Session

1. **Analysis Results**:
   - `/backend_analysis/refined/*.json` - Per-component analysis
   - `/backend_analysis/landmark_locations.json` - Where to place landmarks
   - `/backend_analysis/architectural_patterns.md` - Pattern documentation

2. **Core Scripts**:
   - `/backend_analysis/analyze_backend.py` - Main analyzer (can be reused)
   - `/backend_analysis/analyze_backend_refined.py` - Refined version

## üìù Instructions for Next Claude

### Part 2 Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Landmark Design**
   ```python
   @landmark(
       type="api_contract",
       id="unique-id",
       title="User Registration Endpoint",
       impacts=["security", "user_management"],
       sla="<200ms response time"
   )
   async def register_user(request: UserRequest):
       ...
   ```

2. **Priority Order for Implementation**
   - Design landmark decorator system first
   - Create storage/retrieval infrastructure
   - Start placing landmarks in `shared/` (common patterns)
   - Then move to Hermes (central component)
   - Radiate outward to other components

3. **Important Constraints**
   - DO NOT break existing code functionality
   - Landmarks should be decorators or comments only
   - Must be backwards compatible
   - Keep landmarks lightweight (no performance impact)

### Open Questions for Casey

1. **Landmark Storage**: File-based (JSON) or database (SQLite)?
2. **Landmark IDs**: Auto-generated UUIDs or human-readable?
3. **CI Memory**: How should Numa access landmarks? Direct file access or API?

### Warning About Code State

- All analysis was READ-ONLY - no code was modified
- The codebase is in pristine state
- Test files were excluded but could be analyzed later
- Some singleton patterns may not be detected (only found 1, but more exist)

## üéØ Success Metrics Achieved

Part 1 Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ All Python files analyzed (465 source files)
- ‚úÖ Architecture fully mapped (see architectural_patterns.md)
- ‚úÖ Patterns documented (6 major patterns identified)
- ‚úÖ Landmark locations identified (4,627 locations)

## Part 2 Progress - Landmark Implementation

### ‚úÖ Completed in Part 2

1. **Landmark System Infrastructure**
   - Created `/landmarks/` package with full implementation
   - Base `Landmark` class with specialized types
   - Singleton `LandmarkRegistry` with indexing
   - Decorator system for all landmark types
   - File-based JSON storage with persistence

2. **CI Memory System** 
   - `CIMemory` class for persistent memory across sessions
   - `NumaMemory` specialized for overseer CI with routing
   - Integration with landmark search and retrieval
   - Session management and knowledge persistence

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Comprehensive test suite verifying functionality
   - Working examples in `/landmarks/examples/`
   - Complete README with usage patterns
   - Integration guide for all components

4. **Initial Landmark Placement**
   - Added landmarks to 4 critical shared utilities:
     - `global_config.py` - Singleton pattern, config architecture
     - `graceful_shutdown.py` - Shutdown pattern, Hermes integration  
     - `standard_component.py` - Component lifecycle pattern
     - `mcp_helpers.py` - AI/MCP integration pattern
   - 7 landmarks successfully registered and tested

### üìä Current Statistics

- **Landmark System**: Fully operational ‚úÖ
- **Storage**: `/landmarks/data/` ready for landmarks
- **CI Memory**: `/ci_memory/` ready for CI persistence
- **Components with Landmarks**: 1/15 (shared utilities)
- **Total Landmarks Placed**: 7 (when modules imported)

## üéØ Ready for Next Session

The landmark system is production-ready. Next priorities:

1. **Continue Landmark Placement**
   - Hermes (message bus) - Critical component
   - Apollo (orchestration) - Complex logic
   - Engram (memory) - State management
   - Follow integration guide for each

2. **CLI Tools** (partially complete)
   - Basic stats tool created
   - Need full CLI with add/search/list commands

3. **Component Integration**
   - Each component needs landmark imports
   - Start with high-value architectural decisions
   - Use integration guide for patterns

### Key Files Created

   ```python
   from landmarks import architecture_decision, performance_boundary
   # Add to Hermes, Apollo, etc. following the guide
   ```

2. **Use the Integration Guide**
   - See `/landmarks/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Contains specific examples for each component
   - Best practices and patterns

3. **Monitor Progress**
   ```bash
   python /landmarks/tools/landmark_stats.py
   ```

4. **Test Integration**
   ```bash
   python /landmarks/test_integration.py
   ```

## Important Notes

- ‚úÖ Landmark system is non-invasive (decorators only)
- ‚úÖ Shared utilities are instrumented and working
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to any code
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to import modules to register landmarks

**Note to Casey**: The landmark system is fully operational and I've begun placing landmarks in shared utilities. The system is designed to be completely non-invasive - landmarks are just decorators that don't affect code execution. Ready to continue instrumenting the remaining components!
