# Correction for Bari - Prometheus IS Planning!

Bari, you're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. I see from the screenshot that Prometheus in Tekton is indeed a **Planning** component, not monitoring. 

## Corrected Answers:

### 1. Data Persistence
- Still use the backend API approach
- The backend will handle any persistence needs
- Don't implement SQLite directly in the UI

### 2. UI Functionality - YES, Keep All 6 Tabs!
✅ Planning  
✅ Timeline  
✅ Resources  
✅ Analysis  
✅ Planning Chat  
✅ Team Chat  

These are all correct and should be maintained!

### 3. AI Integration - Confirmed
- Planning Chat → `window.AIChat.sendMessage('prometheus', message)`
- Team Chat → `window.AIChat.teamChat(message, 'prometheus')`
- The error message in the screenshot shows AI integration needs fixing

### 4. Priority - Same Order
1. CSS-first navigation
2. Fix configuration (os.environ → GlobalConfig)
3. Remove mocks and connect APIs
4. Fix AI integration error shown in screenshot
5. Landmarks and semantic tags

### Time Estimate
- Your 4-6 hours estimate is reasonable for a 6-tab component
- The Planning/Timeline/Resources features might have complex visualizations

Sorry for the initial confusion! You're on the right track. The screenshot confirms everything you found.
