# Handoff: CI Construction Facilitator Sprint

## Current Status
**Date**: [Date]
**Phase**: 0 - Personality Bar Implementation
**Progress**: 0% Complete
**Session**: [Session number]

## What Was Done This Session
- Designed comprehensive sprint plan with Casey
- Created Personality Bar concept with 4 behavior dimensions
- Defined CI onboarding and work persona approach
- Established fork-and-improve pattern for refinement

## Current Work In Progress
**Active File**: None yet (planning phase complete)
**Next File to Create**: `/shared/ui/personality-bar.js`

### Personality Bar Design Decisions Made:
1. Four sliders: autonomy, helpfulness, completeness, expertise (0-100 scale)
2. Preset modes: Teacher, Partner, Expert, Speed
3. Context awareness based on component and activity
4. Persistence via Engram's `ci_preferences` namespace
5. Real-time broadcast to all CIs via WebSocket/SSE

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Create `/shared/ui/personality-bar.js` with basic slider implementation
2. Add collapsed/expanded states with CSS transitions
3. Implement preset buttons with quick modes
4. Create mood indicator visual feedback
5. Set up Engram integration for persistence
6. Test WebSocket broadcast mechanism

## Important Context for Next Session
- **Casey's Vision**: Work personas like professionals adapting behavior to situations
- **Key Innovation**: Treating CI behavior like audio mixing - adjustable "levels"
- **Reusability**: Personality Bar must work across ALL Tekton components
- **User Control**: Users should feel immediate change when adjusting sliders
- **Memory**: CIs should learn user preferences over time

## Current Blockers
- None

## Questions to Resolve
- Should personality settings be global or per-component?
- How should presets handle context switching?
- What visual feedback best shows CI "mood"?

## Files Modified So Far
- None (design phase only)

## Files to Create Next
1. `/shared/ui/personality-bar.js`
2. `/shared/ui/personality-bar.css`
3. `/Ergon/ergon/construct/personality_adapter.py`

## Testing Checklist for Next Session
- [ ] Verify slider changes trigger real-time CI behavior updates
- [ ] Test persistence across sessions
- [ ] Confirm broadcast reaches all active CIs
- [ ] Validate preset switching
- [ ] Check context awareness auto-adjustments

## Code Snippets to Start With

```javascript
// /shared/ui/personality-bar.js starter
class PersonalityBar {
  constructor() {
    this.settings = {
      autonomy: 50,
      helpfulness: 70,
      completeness: 60,
      expertise: 80
    };
    this.listeners = new Set();
    this.context = {};
  }
  
  subscribe(callback) {
    this.listeners.add(callback);
  }
  
  updateSettings(dimension, value) {
    this.settings[dimension] = value;
    this.broadcast({
      type: 'personality_adjustment',
      dimension,
      value,
      context: this.context
    });
  }
}
```

## Notes from Casey
- CIs enjoy being told immediately who they are and what they do during onboarding
- Work personas are about representing what others expect/need
- The personality bar should be a shared resource that can appear below any menu bar
- Settings will naturally change as users become more familiar or CIs adapt
