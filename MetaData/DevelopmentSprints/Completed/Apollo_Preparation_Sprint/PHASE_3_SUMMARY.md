# Phase 3 Summary: Knowledge Graph Integration

## What Was Built

### Landmark Manager (`landmark_manager.py`)
A complete system for converting memories into navigable knowledge graph nodes:
- Converts MemoryItems to landmark entities with Apollo namespace
- Automatically detects relationships between memories
- Provides export format compatible with Athena's graph
- Generates Cypher queries for future Neo4j integration

### Relationship Detection
Intelligent analysis finds connections between memories:
- **Temporal**: BEFORE, AFTER, DURING based on timestamps
- **Causal**: CAUSED_BY, LED_TO based on memory types
- **Resolution**: RESOLVED_BY when plans address errors
- **Reference**: REFERENCES when content mentions other memories

### Integration Points
- Context Brief Manager creates landmarks automatically on memory storage
- MCP tools expose landmark functionality to CIs
- Export format ready for Athena import
- Local JSON storage with graph-ready structure

## How It Works

### Memory â†’ Landmark Flow
```
1. Memory stored in Context Brief Manager
2. Landmark Manager creates graph node
3. Relationships analyzed with other memories
4. Landmark stored with Apollo namespace
5. Available via MCP tools
```

### Landmark Structure
```json
{
  "entity_id": "lmk_decision_mem_001",
  "entity_type": "memory_landmark",
  "namespace": "apollo",
  "name": "Redux state management decision",
  "properties": {
    "memory_type": "decision",
    "ci_source": "ergon-ci",
    "tags": ["redux", "architecture"],
    "priority": 8,
    "timestamp": "2025-08-29T16:00:00Z"
  },
  "confidence": 0.8
}
```

### Relationship Structure
```json
{
  "relationship_id": "rel_abc123",
  "source_id": "lmk_error_mem_002",
  "target_id": "lmk_decision_mem_003",
  "relationship_type": "LED_TO",
  "namespace": "apollo",
  "confidence": 0.8
}
```

## MCP Tools Added

### get_landmarks
Retrieve landmarks from the graph:
```python
await get_landmarks(
    ci_name="ergon-ci",  # Optional filter
    include_relationships=True
)
```

### analyze_memory_relationships
Find and create relationships:
```python
await analyze_memory_relationships(
    create_relationships=True
)
```

## Testing Results

Successfully tested with 4 related memories:
- Created 4 landmark nodes
- Found 8 relationships automatically
- Export format validated
- Cypher queries generated correctly

## Integration with Athena

### Current State
- Landmarks stored locally in JSON
- Export format matches Athena's entity/relationship schema
- Apollo namespace keeps memories separate from codebase

### Future Integration
1. Call Athena's MCP tools to store landmarks
2. Use Athena's graph queries for traversal
3. Visualize memory relationships in UI
4. Enable cross-namespace queries for insights

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/landmark_manager.py` (385 lines)
- `/Apollo/apollo/core/preparation/test_landmarks.py` (141 lines)

### Modified
- `context_brief.py`: Added landmark creation and queries
- `preparation_tools.py`: Added 2 new MCP tools

## What This Enables

1. **Memory Navigation**: Traverse related memories through graph
2. **Pattern Discovery**: See how errors lead to decisions
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Understand sequence of events
4. **Context Building**: Include related memories in briefs
5. **Knowledge Persistence**: Memories become permanent knowledge

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Phase 4: Build UI for browsing landmarks
- Phase 5: Hook integration for automatic capture
- Phase 6: Clean up Rhetor

### Future Enhancements
- Live Athena integration via MCP
- Neo4j backend for production
- Graph visualization in UI
- Cross-namespace queries
- Machine learning on relationships
