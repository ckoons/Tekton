# Phase 6 Summary: Rhetor Cleanup

## What Was Done

### Removed from Rhetor
Successfully removed all memory-related code from Rhetor:
- Deleted `memory_catalog.py`
- Deleted `memory_presenter.py`
- Deleted `memory_endpoints.py`
- Deleted `test_memory_catalog.py`
- Removed memory router from main app
- Cleaned up pycache files

### Added Apollo Client
Created `apollo_client.py` in Rhetor to communicate with Apollo:
- Async client using aiohttp
- Calls Apollo's MCP endpoints
- Methods for Context Brief retrieval
- Memory storage and search capabilities
- Singleton pattern for efficiency

### Updated Rhetor API
Modified `app_enhanced.py` to use Apollo:
- Calls Apollo for Context Briefs before LLM completion
- Integrates brief into system prompt
- Graceful fallback if Apollo unavailable
- Maintains all existing functionality

## How It Works Now

### Before (Rhetor-owned memory):
```python
# Memory was internal to Rhetor
catalog = MemoryCatalog()
memories = catalog.get_relevant_memories(ci_name)
```

### After (Apollo-owned memory):
```python
# Rhetor asks Apollo via MCP
apollo = get_apollo_client()
context_brief = await apollo.get_context_brief(
    ci_name="ergon-ci",
    message="Current context",
    max_tokens=500
)
```

### Request Flow
1. Rhetor receives completion request with component_name
2. Rhetor calls Apollo MCP for Context Brief
3. Apollo prepares brief from memory catalog
4. Rhetor adds brief to system prompt
5. LLM processes with full context
6. Response returned to caller

## Files Modified/Created

### Deleted from Rhetor
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/memory_catalog.py`
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/memory_presenter.py`
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/test_memory_catalog.py`
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/memory_endpoints.py`

### Created
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/apollo_client.py` (265 lines)
- `/Rhetor/README_MEMORY_MIGRATION.md` (documentation)

### Modified
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/app_enhanced.py` (added Apollo integration)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean Separation**: Rhetor focuses solely on LLM orchestration
2. **Centralized Memory**: Apollo owns all preparation/memory
3. **MCP Communication**: CIs use standardized protocol
4. **No Duplication**: Single source of truth for memories
5. **Backward Compatible**: Rhetor still works if Apollo unavailable

## Migration Impact

### For Developers
- Use Apollo API for memory operations
- Update any scripts using old `/api/memory` endpoints
- Set `APOLLO_URL` environment variable

### For CIs
- Automatically get Context Briefs via Rhetor
- No changes needed to existing CI code
- Memory extraction happens transparently

### For Users
- Memory management now in Apollo UI
- Better visualization and control
- Unified preparation interface

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Rhetor starts without memory modules
- [ ] Apollo client connects successfully
- [ ] Context Briefs retrieved correctly
- [ ] Graceful fallback when Apollo down
- [ ] System prompts include context

### Integration Testing
- [ ] CI requests get context
- [ ] Memory storage works via Apollo
- [ ] Search functionality operational
- [ ] Statistics accurate

## Known Issues

1. **Timeout Risk**: Apollo calls add latency (5s timeout set)
2. **Network Dependency**: Rhetor now depends on Apollo being up
3. **Migration Path**: Existing memory data needs manual migration

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Test full integration with CIs
- Migrate any existing memory data
- Update deployment scripts

### Phase 5 (Still Pending)
- Add hooks to specialist_worker.py
- Automatic memory extraction
- Pre-message Context Brief injection

## Cleanup Complete

Rhetor is now simplified and focused on its core responsibility: intelligent LLM orchestration. All memory and preparation functionality has been successfully migrated to Apollo, where it architecturally belongs as the "library god" of the Tekton system.

**Phase 6 Complete!**
