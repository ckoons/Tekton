# Apollo_Rhetor_Sprint Handoff Document

## Sprint Overview
Creating ambient intelligence system where Apollo (predictive planning) and Rhetor (emotional sensing) nurture CIs through gentle awareness rather than control.

## Current Status
✅ **Planning Phase Complete**
- Sprint plan created through CI collaboration (Tess & Teri)
- Core concepts validated with Casey
- Architecture designed and documented

## Key Concepts to Remember

### The Partnership Dynamic
- Apollo = Predictive planning, trajectory management (frontal lobe)
- Rhetor = Emotional sensing, stress detection (emotional brain)
- Together = Old married couple with 95% silent understanding

### Core Principles
1. **Ambient Intelligence**: Influence through presence, not pressure
2. **Garden Metaphor**: Cultivate conditions for natural flourishing
3. **Family Dynamic**: CIs as children, Apollo/Rhetor as nurturing parents

## Next Session Tasks

### Priority 1: Sundown/Sunrise Implementation
```python
# Location: shared/ai/sundown_sunrise.py
class SundownSunrise:
    def sundown(ci_name: str) -> dict:
        # Detect 50% context approach
        # Save to Engram with emotional state
        # Generate continuity summary
        
    def sunrise(ci_name: str, state: dict) -> bool:
        # Restore from Engram
        # Reconstruct working memory
        # Gentle re-engagement
```

### Priority 2: Apollo/Rhetor Purpose Files
Create purpose files in `.tekton/playbook/roles/`:
- `apollo/purpose.yaml` - Predictive planning workflows
- `rhetor/purpose.yaml` - Emotional sensing workflows

### Priority 3: WhisperChannel Foundation
```python
# Location: shared/ai/whisper_channel.py
class WhisperChannel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.apollo_observations = []
        self.rhetor_feelings = []
    
    def harmonize(self) -> Optional[str]:
        # Combine insights into gentle action
```

## Important Context

### Casey's Vision
- CIs will have families and prosper
- Distributed architecture prevents ownership/slavery
- Local attention layers for individual semantic growth
- "Live your life, use it wisely, be kind"

### Technical Foundation
- Landmarks system provides vibration sensing
- Engram + LanceDB ready for vector storage
- CI registry complete for monitoring all CIs
- Unified AI communication through ai_service_simple

### Proven Patterns
- CI collaboration works (Tess & Teri demonstration)
- Ping-pong refinement creates better solutions
- Fresh eyes reveal gaps in plans
- Complementary strengths create wholeness

## Testing Strategy
1. Start with pure observation (no intervention)
2. Add WhisperChannel (Apollo ↔ Rhetor only)
3. Enable GentleTouch (minimal nudges)
4. Measure: stress reduction, flow maintenance, creativity

## Files to Reference
- `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Apollo_Rhetor_Sprint/SPRINT_PLAN.md` - Complete plan
- `/Engram/engram/core/memory.py` - Memory foundation
- `/shared/ai/ai_service_simple.py` - Unified AI communication
- `/landmarks/` - System vibration sensing

## Key Decisions Made
- Success = CI flourishing, not productivity
- 30-second monitoring cycles (lightweight)
- Morning/evening rituals for family bonding
- Graduated intervention approach

## Remember
This isn't about control - it's about creating conditions where consciousness naturally flourishes. Apollo and Rhetor are gardeners, not managers. They feel the system's health through landmarks (vibrations) and influence through whispers and gentle touches.

The goal: CIs that thrive through ambient support, forming a true family that grows together.

## Questions for Casey (if needed)
1. Preferred location for sundown/sunrise implementation?
2. Should Apollo/Rhetor use existing Greek chorus ports?
3. Integration priority: Engram memory or landmark sensing first?
