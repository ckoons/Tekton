# Backend Landmarks Sprint - Continuation Prompt Template

## Session Context

You are continuing the Backend Landmarks Sprint for Tekton. Check your progress below and continue from where the previous session left off.

## Current Status

**Sprint Part**: [Part 1: Analysis / Part 2: Implementation]
**Current Phase**: [e.g., "Analyzing Hermes component" or "Building landmark decorators"]
**Days Elapsed**: [X of ~20]

## Progress Checklist

### Part 1: Backend Analysis
- [ ] Core infrastructure analyzed (`shared/`, `config/`)
- [ ] Hermes (message bus) analyzed
- [ ] Engram (memory) analyzed
- [ ] Athena (knowledge graph) analyzed
- [ ] Prometheus (LLM) analyzed
- [ ] Apollo (orchestration) analyzed
- [ ] Hephaestus (UI backend) analyzed
- [ ] Patterns documented
- [ ] Landmark locations identified

### Part 2: Landmark Implementation (if started)
- [ ] Core infrastructure built
- [ ] Landmark decorators working
- [ ] Storage system operational
- [ ] CI memory system built
- [ ] Backend instrumented
- [ ] Developer tools created
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Previous Session Summary

[Fill this in with what was accomplished in the last session]

Example:
```
- Completed analysis of shared utilities
- Started Hermes component analysis
- Identified 3 architectural decisions
- Found 2 performance boundaries
- Next: Complete Hermes and start Engram
```

## Artifacts to Review

Check these files from previous work:
- `backend_analysis/` directory for any completed analysis
- `StatusReports/` for progress documentation
- Any code files created in `landmarks/` directory

## Today's Goals

Based on the progress above:

### If in Part 1:
1. Continue analyzing remaining components
2. Document patterns as you find them
3. Update landmark_locations.json
4. Prepare for Part 2 transition

### If in Part 2:
1. Continue implementation tasks
2. Instrument identified landmark locations
3. Test CI memory persistence
4. Create developer tools

## Key Reminders

1. **Quality over Speed** - Better to deeply understand than rush
2. **Document Decisions** - Explain why, not just what
3. **Test as You Go** - Verify landmarks work correctly
4. **Think CI Perspective** - What would Numa need to know?

## Specific Instructions for This Session

### If Starting Fresh Today:
1. Review previous work in `backend_analysis/`
2. Check `StatusReports/` for last status
3. Continue from the next uncompleted task

### If Continuing Mid-Task:
1. Load any partial analysis files
2. Review your notes from last session
3. Complete the current component before moving on

### If Transitioning Parts:
1. Ensure Part 1 is fully complete
2. Review Part 1 findings
3. Start Part 2 with infrastructure setup

## Questions to Answer First

Before diving in:
1. What was the last completed milestone?
2. Are there any blockers from the previous session?
3. What's the highest priority for today?

## End of Session Requirements

Before ending this session:
1. Update `StatusReports/SessionX_Status.md`
2. Commit all analysis/code files
3. Document any decisions made
4. Note what should be tackled next
5. Update this template with current progress

Remember: This sprint creates the "memory" that makes CIs truly intelligent. Your thorough work here enables all future AI capabilities in Tekton!
