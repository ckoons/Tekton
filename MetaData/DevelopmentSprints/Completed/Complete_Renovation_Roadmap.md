# Complete Tekton UI Renovation Roadmap

## âœ… Completed Components
1. **Terma** - Original pattern source (reference implementation)
2. **Apollo** - 8 tabs, first renovation (by Teri/Claude)
3. **Athena** - 5 tabs, knowledge graph (by Teri/Claude)

## ðŸš€ Ready for Tomorrow (Parallel Work)

### Coder-A: Teri/Claude
- **Hermes** (6 tabs) - Messaging hub, complex but critical

### Coder-B: New Claude
- **Prometheus** (4 tabs) - Monitoring, good starter project

### Coder-C: New Claude  
- **Harmonia** (3 tabs) - Workflows, simpler starter project

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Components (Suggested Order)

### Week 1 - Building Confidence
4. **Telos** (3 tabs) - Goals/objectives tracking
5. **Rhetor** (5 tabs) - LLM interaction interface
6. **Noesis** (4 tabs) - Intelligence/insights

### Week 2 - Medium Complexity
7. **Ergon** (6 tabs) - Task management
8. **Metis** (4 tabs) - Wisdom/strategy component
9. **Budget/Penia** (4 tabs) - Resource management

### Week 3 - Higher Complexity
10. **Synthesis** (7 tabs) - Integration hub
11. **Sophia** (5 tabs) - Knowledge base
12. **Engram** (4 tabs) - Memory/context management

### Week 4 - Specialized Components
13. **Numa** (3 tabs) - Neural architecture
14. **Codex** (4 tabs) - Code management
15. **Profile** (3 tabs) - User settings
16. **Settings** (5 tabs) - System configuration

### Special Cases
- **tekton-dashboard** - Main dashboard (may need special handling)
- **tekton** - Core component (verify if renovation needed)
- **shared** - Common utilities (not a component)

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### 3 Parallel Tracks
1. **Track A (Teri/Claude)**: Complex components (6+ tabs)
2. **Track B (Claude 2)**: Medium components (4-5 tabs)  
3. **Track C (Claude 3)**: Simpler components (3-4 tabs)

### Daily Velocity
- Each Claude: 1-2 components per day
- Total: 3-6 components per day
- Estimated completion: 5-7 working days

## Success Metrics
- Zero onclick handlers
- All mock data removed
- Real API integration
- CSS-first navigation
- Footer always visible
- Proper landmarks/semantic tags

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with easier components to build confidence
- Share learnings between Claudes daily
- Test thoroughly before moving to next component
- Keep Casey's patterns sacred

"Simple, works, hard to screw up" - This is the way!
