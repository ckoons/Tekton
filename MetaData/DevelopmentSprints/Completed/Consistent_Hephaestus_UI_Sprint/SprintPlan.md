# Consistent Hephaestus UI Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Consistent Hephaestus UI Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple CI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on standardizing the Hephaestus UI framework across all components and implementing consistent chat interfaces throughout the system.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **CSS-First Framework Migration**: Convert all remaining Tekton components to the CSS-first architecture pattern established in Rhetor, Numa, Noesis, Settings, Profile, and Terma
2. **Consistent Chat Implementation**: Implement Specialist Chat and Team Chat interfaces across all components following Rhetor's proven pattern
3. **Semantic Tagging Standardization**: Ensure all components use consistent `data-tekton-*` attributes for improved maintainability and debugging

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Improved Reliability**: Eliminating JavaScript-based navigation reduces failure points and race conditions
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Instant tab switching and consistent behavior across all components
- **Better Maintainability**: Standardized patterns make the codebase easier to understand and modify
- **Unified Communication**: Consistent chat interfaces enable seamless CI collaboration across the platform
- **Developer Efficiency**: CSS-first approach reduces debugging time and simplifies component development

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The Hephaestus UI currently has a split personality:

**Modern CSS-First Components (6):**
- Numa, Noesis, Settings, Profile, Terma, Rhetor
- Use radio button pattern for tab navigation
- No JavaScript onclick handlers
- Consistent semantic tagging with `data-tekton-*` attributes
- Clean separation of concerns

**Legacy JavaScript Components (15+):**
- Apollo, Athena, Engram, Ergon, Harmonia, Hermes, Metis, Prometheus, Sophia, Synthesis, Tekton, Telos, Budget/Penia, Codex, Tekton-Dashboard
- Use JavaScript onclick handlers for tabs
- Active state managed via JavaScript classes
- Inconsistent semantic tagging
- Tighter coupling between HTML and JavaScript

**Chat Implementation:**
- Only Rhetor has fully implemented chat interfaces
- Team Chat exists but is not integrated into other components
- Specialist Chat pattern established but not propagated

### Pain Points

- **Navigation Inconsistency**: Users experience different behaviors across components
- **JavaScript Fragility**: onclick handlers can fail, leaving components in broken states
- **Maintenance Burden**: Two different patterns require developers to context-switch
- **Limited CI Interaction**: Most components lack proper chat interfaces for CI assistance
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Inconsistent patterns make troubleshooting harder

## Proposed Approach

### High-Level Strategy

1. **Systematic Migration**: Convert components one-by-one to minimize risk
2. **Pattern Replication**: Use Rhetor as the gold standard template
3. **Incremental Testing**: Verify each component works before moving to the next
4. **Chat Integration**: Add both Specialist and Team Chat to each component

### Key Components Affected

- **15+ UI Components**: All legacy components will be migrated to CSS-first
- **Chat System**: Team Chat will be integrated into all components
- **Navigation System**: Unified radio button pattern across all components
- **CSS Architecture**: Consistent use of `:checked` selectors
- **Semantic Tagging**: Standardized `data-tekton-*` attributes

### Technical Approach

1. **Radio Button Pattern**: Replace all onclick handlers with hidden radio inputs and labels
2. **CSS State Management**: Use `:checked` pseudo-selectors for active states
3. **Chat Component Reuse**: Create shared chat components to avoid duplication
4. **Semantic HTML**: Ensure proper ARIA labels and semantic structure
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Components work without JavaScript (except WebSocket features)

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information
- File trace patterns must be added to new JavaScript files

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Clear comments explaining the radio button pattern for future developers
- Semantic tag documentation for each component
- Chat integration points clearly marked
- Migration notes for each converted component

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Visual regression tests for each migrated component
- Tab navigation functionality tests
- Chat interface integration tests
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Backend API changes (unless required for chat integration)
- New feature development beyond chat interfaces
- Visual design changes (maintaining current aesthetics)
- Performance optimizations beyond those inherent in CSS-first approach
- Mobile-specific enhancements

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Rhetor component as the reference implementation
- Existing Team Chat implementation
- WebSocket infrastructure for chat functionality
- Current CI specialist endpoints

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Framework Migration
- **Duration**: 2-3 sessions
- **Focus**: Converting components from JavaScript to CSS-first pattern
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - All 15+ components migrated to radio button pattern
  - Consistent semantic tagging implemented
  - Navigation working without JavaScript

### Phase 2: Chat Implementation
- **Duration**: 2 sessions
- **Focus**: Adding Specialist and Team Chat to all components
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Specialist Chat integrated with each component's AI
  - Team Chat accessible from all components
  - WebSocket connections properly managed

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement
- **Duration**: 1 session
- **Focus**: Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - All components tested across browsers
  - Documentation updated
  - Debug instrumentation verified

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Component breaks during migration | High | Medium | Test each component thoroughly before moving to next |
| Chat integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Use Rhetor's implementation as proven template |
| CSS selector conflicts | Low | Medium | Use component-specific namespacing |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari early |
| WebSocket connection management | High | Low | Reuse existing connection infrastructure |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- All 15+ legacy components migrated to CSS-first pattern
- Tab navigation works instantly without JavaScript
- Specialist Chat available in every component
- Team Chat accessible from all components
- All components pass visual regression tests
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Debug instrumentation implemented throughout

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager and Tekton creator
- **Kari (Claude)**: Sprint architect and initial implementer
- **Future Claude Sessions**: Continued implementation and testing
