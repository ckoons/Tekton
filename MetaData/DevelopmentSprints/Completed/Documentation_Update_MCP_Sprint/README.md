# Documentation Update: MCP Distributed Tekton Sprint

## Purpose
Document the transformation of aish into an MCP server and migration of all UI chat interfaces to use the MCP protocol instead of direct HTTP calls.

## Sprint Summary
- **Sprint Name**: MCP Distributed Tekton Sprint
- **Date**: 2025-01-18
- **Sprint Start Date**: 2025-01-16  
- **Start Commit**: 3868ecf

## What Was Actually Built

### Phase 1: aish MCP Server (90% Complete)
- Created `/shared/aish/src/mcp/server.py` with FastAPI MCP implementation
- Implemented all MCP endpoints for message routing, forwarding, and team chat
- Added MCP server management commands (status, restart, logs, debug-mcp)
- MCP server runs on port 8118 (AISH_MCP_PORT)

### Phase 2: UI Migration to MCP (95% Complete)  
- Updated window.AIChat to route through aish MCP
- Fixed all specialist components to use correct AI names (no '-ai' suffix)
- Updated tekton-urls.js with aishUrl() function
- Fixed Team Chat to return properly formatted responses
- Updated env.js generation to include AISH_PORT and AISH_MCP_PORT

## Key Principles

### Do:
- ✓ Document actual implementation
- ✓ Update examples to working code
- ✓ Remove outdated information
- ✓ Create release notes
- ✓ Focus on developer/CI needs

### Don't:
- ✗ Document planned features that weren't built
- ✗ Update unrelated documentation  
- ✗ Rewrite working documentation
- ✗ Create extensive prose
- ✗ Update docs before code

## Documentation Priority

1. **Breaking Changes** - Must document immediately
2. **New Patterns** - Developers need to know
3. **API Changes** - Affects integration
4. **New Features** - How to use them
5. **Bug Fixes** - Only if behavior changed

## Success Metrics

- Developers can use new features without asking questions
- Examples compile and run correctly
- No references to old patterns remain
- CI training is updated for new capabilities

## Time Estimate

- Small sprint (1-2 components): 1 day
- Medium sprint (3-5 components): 2 days  
- Large sprint (architecture changes): 3-4 days

Remember: Good documentation follows good code. Update what matters, delete what doesn't.
