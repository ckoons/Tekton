# Sprint: Documentation Update - MCP Distributed Tekton

## Overview
Update Tekton documentation to reflect the transformation of aish into an MCP server and migration of all UI chat interfaces to use MCP protocol. Focus on documenting what was actually built, not what was planned.

## Goals
1. **Capture Changes**: Document what actually changed in the code
2. **Update Guides**: Ensure guides reflect new patterns/features
3. **Fix Examples**: Update code examples to match current implementation

## Phase 1: Change Analysis [100% Complete]

## What Changed
- [Feature/Fix]: [Description]
- [Feature/Fix]: [Description]

## Breaking Changes
- [If any]

## Migration Steps
1. [If needed]

## Known Issues
- [If any]

## Testing
- Run: `[test command]`
```

## Technical Decisions
- Document after code, not before
- Focus on what developers/CIs actually need
- Remove outdated information rather than updating it
- Use examples from actual code

## Out of Scope
- Creating new documentation categories
- Rewriting unchanged documentation
- Updating all documentation (only what changed)
