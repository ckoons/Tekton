# Daily Progress Log: Federation and Till System

## Day 1: 2024-08-31

### Completed
- [x] Brainstormed federation architecture with Casey
- [x] Designed trust-based relationship model (solo/observer/member)
- [x] Created concept of asymmetric relationships between Tektons
- [x] Designed Till as configuration manager with public/private split
- [x] Developed ephemeral branch system with TTL for GitHub management
- [x] Created sprint documentation structure
- [x] Designed flexible naming system (name.category.geography with FQN)
- [x] Added cryptographic identity verification using public keys
- [x] Incorporated core protocol verbs (Discover, Negotiate, Resolve, Diagnose)
- [x] Defined federation status filtering and grouping strategies
- [x] Established "working code wins" principle - no gatekeepers
- [x] Specified fixed 4-byte aligned fields for protocol efficiency

### In Progress
- [ ] Finalizing implementation details for Till sync operation
- [ ] Detailing CI-based README interpretation for metadata

### Blocked
- [ ] Nothing currently blocking

### Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use individual sovereignty model instead of hierarchical federation
  - **Why**: Natural growth of communities, no central authority needed
  - **Impact**: Each Tekton manages its own relationships independently

- **Decision**: Split Till configuration into public (GitHub) and private (local) components
  - **Why**: Maintain privacy while enabling discovery and sharing
  - **Impact**: Till must manage synchronization between public and private

- **Decision**: Use ephemeral branches with TTL for federation data
  - **Why**: Prevents repository clutter, natural lifecycle for temporary data
  - **Impact**: Need branch registry and automatic cleanup mechanism

- **Decision**: Support asymmetric relationships (A→B different from B→A)
  - **Why**: Reflects real-world trust relationships
  - **Impact**: Relationship checking must be directional

- **Decision**: HOLD mechanism with expiration dates
  - **Why**: Prevents forgotten holds from blocking updates indefinitely
  - **Impact**: Till must track and automatically expire holds

- **Decision**: Implement flexible FQN naming (name.category.geography.etc)
  - **Why**: Allows both simple and fully qualified names as needed for uniqueness
  - **Impact**: First-come gets clean namespace, others must qualify

- **Decision**: Use public key cryptography for identity verification
  - **Why**: Prevents identity spoofing, proves ownership of names
  - **Impact**: Each Tekton generates keypair, signs all updates

- **Decision**: Fixed 4-byte aligned protocol fields
  - **Why**: Avoid variable-length parsing complexity, enable efficient processing
  - **Impact**: Clean, predictable packet structure with room for growth

- **Decision**: Include core verbs: Discover, Negotiate, Resolve, Diagnose
  - **Why**: Essential operations for network debugging and federation management
  - **Impact**: Built into protocol from day one, not added later

### Questions for Casey
- [x] ~~Should Till be implemented in Python or as a C program?~~ → **C confirmed**
- [x] ~~Till's scope?~~ → **Complete lifecycle manager, not just federation**
- [ ] What should the menu-of-the-day JSON structure look like exactly?
- [ ] What's the future GitHub organization name (replacing ckoons)?
- [ ] Should we embed cJSON or use jq via system() calls?

### Key Insights from Discussion
1. **Till Evolution**: Expanded from federation tool to complete Tekton lifecycle manager
2. **Installation First**: Till handles Tekton installation, then optionally federation
3. **Solo Support**: Even non-federated instances use Till for updates (avoiding manual git pulls)
4. **Branch Registration**: Use ephemeral branches for registration, encode data in branch name if possible
5. **C Implementation**: Lightweight, portable, no external dependencies except git/gh
6. **Host Management**: Till manages multiple Tekton instances on different hosts via till-private.json

### Next Session Focus
- Create Till C project structure with Makefile
- Implement till_config.h with all configuration constants
- Build basic command parser for till commands
- Design menu-of-the-day JSON structure
- Implement core till sync functionality
