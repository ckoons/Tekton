# Ergon Rewrite Sprint - Handoff Document

## Current Status
**Phase**: Planning Complete, Ready for Phase 1
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Overall Progress**: 5% (Planning done)

## Context for Next Session

### What Was Done
1. Created comprehensive design for Ergon v2 as a reusability expert
2. Defined 5-phase implementation plan
3. Set up sprint documentation structure
4. Identified key technical decisions

### Current State
- Existing Ergon has database session errors preventing it from working
- Casey approved complete rewrite with new focus
- Sprint plan created and ready for implementation
- All design decisions documented

## Next Session Should

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 Start)
1. **Archive Existing Ergon**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Coder-A/Ergon
   mkdir ergon_v1_archive
   mv ergon/* ergon_v1_archive/
   ```

2. **Create New Structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ergon/core/{database,registry,analysis,configuration,expert}
   mkdir -p ergon/api
   ```

3. **Create StandardComponentBase**:
   - Copy pattern from Numa or other recent components
   - Set up proper initialization
   - Configure port 8102

4. **Design Database Schema**:
   - Create models.py with SQLAlchemy
   - Define solutions, capabilities, integrations tables
   - Set up database initialization

### Key Information
- **Port**: 8102 (Ergon's assigned port)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexibility
- **UI Location**: /Hephaestus/ui/components/ergon/
- **Color Scheme**: Keep existing Ergon colors
- **Chat Integration**: Must include Tool Chat and Team Chat

### Design Highlights to Remember
1. **Solution Registry**: Catalog of tools, agents, MCP servers, workflows
2. **Analysis Engine**: GitHub repo scanner for reusable components
3. **Configuration Engine**: Smart wrapper and config generation
4. **Expert System**: Conversational interface for finding/configuring solutions

### Critical Requirements
- No mock data - must work with real solutions
- Must integrate Tool Chat for Ergon CI
- Must integrate Team Chat for multi-component coordination
- Follow StandardComponentBase pattern
- Use CSS-first approach for UI

## Blockers/Issues
None currently - ready to begin implementation

## Questions for Casey
None pending - design was approved

## Files to Reference
- `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Ergon_Rewrite_Sprint/SPRINT_PLAN.md` - Full sprint plan
- `/MetaData/StandardPatterns/ServiceClassPattern.md` - Component patterns
- Recent components like Numa for StandardComponentBase example

## Success Metrics for Next Session
- [ ] Ergon v1 archived successfully
- [ ] New Ergon structure created
- [ ] Basic component running on port 8102
- [ ] Database schema designed
- [ ] At least one endpoint working

Remember: Focus is on reusability and configuration, not building new tools!
