- Footer uses position: absolute, bottom: 0
- Content area has margin-bottom to prevent overlap

### 3. Real API Integration âœ…

- Service registry and message monitoring use real data
- No mock data removal was needed (component was already clean)

### 4. Chat Functionality âœ…
- Updated chat code to work with radio button state detection
- Added proper error handling for missing AIChat service
- Integrated with aish MCP (confirmed working on port 8118)
- Both Message/Data Chat and Team Chat functional

- All existing data-tekton-* attributes preserved
- Proper semantic tagging for navigation, panels, and footer

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/Hephaestus/ui/components/hermes/hermes-component.html`

### Key Changes
1. Added 6 radio inputs for tabs
2. Converted div onclick to label elements
3. Added CSS rules for radio-based navigation
4. Updated JavaScript to detect active tab via radio state
5. Added script includes for tekton-urls.js and ai-chat.js

### Chat Integration
- Message/Data Chat: `window.AIChat.sendMessage('hermes', message)`
- Team Chat: `window.AIChat.teamChat(message, 'hermes')`
- Confirmed aish MCP running on port 8118

## Testing Results
- Navigation: Working perfectly with CSS-first pattern
- Chat: Confirmed working with test message
- Service Registry: Displays real service data
- Message Monitor: Ready for real-time monitoring
- Footer: Always visible as required

## Patterns Followed
- Copied Terma's CSS-first navigation pattern exactly
- Followed Apollo/Athena's chat implementation
- Maintained BEM naming convention
- Preserved all semantic tags

## Next Steps
- Component is fully renovated and functional
- Ready for production use
- Can serve as reference for renovating other 6-tab components

## Notes
- Initial report of "neither chat works" was due to needing script includes
- After adding scripts and confirming aish MCP is running, chat is functional
- The component demonstrates successful renovation of a complex 6-tab interface

"Simple, works, hard to screw up" - Mission accomplished! ðŸŽ‰
