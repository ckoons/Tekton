# LLM Adapter Removal Summary

## ✅ Completed Removals

### Files Deleted (26 files, ~10,000 lines removed):
- ✅ All component LLM adapter files (`*/core/llm_adapter.py`)
- ✅ Shared migration file (`shared/llm_adapter_migration.py`)  
- ✅ All example files and scripts
- ✅ UI adapter client (`llm_adapter_client.js`)
- ✅ All LLM adapter documentation
- ✅ Test files that imported adapters

### Imports Cleaned:
- ✅ Removed `from ... import llm_adapter` statements
- ✅ Removed `from ... import LLMAdapter` statements

## ⚠️ Files Needing Manual Updates

These files have actual usage of LLMAdapter that needs to be replaced with Rhetor calls:

### 1. **Engram/engram/api/llm_endpoints.py**
   - Has `get_llm_adapter()` dependency injection
   - Needs to use Rhetor client instead

### 2. **Metis/metis/core/task_decomposer.py**
   - Constructor takes `llm_adapter` parameter
   - Line 36: `self.llm_adapter` is commented out but usage remains
   - Needs Rhetor client for task decomposition

### 3. **Sophia/sophia/core/recommendation_system.py**
   - Lines 593, 784: `get_llm_adapter()` calls commented out
   - Subsequent usage of `llm_adapter` needs replacement

### 4. **Prometheus/prometheus/api/endpoints/llm_integration.py**
   - Uses PrometheusLLMAdapter
   - Needs Rhetor integration

### 5. **Budget/budget/service/assistant.py**
   - Line 552: Import removed but may have usage
   - Check for `get_llm_client()` calls

### 6. **Terma/terma/api/app.py**
   - Multiple LLMAdapter imports removed
   - Check endpoints for usage

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Update each component to use Rhetor:**
   ```python
   # Instead of:
   from component.llm_adapter import LLMAdapter
   adapter = LLMAdapter()
   
   # Use:
   from rhetor.client import RhetorClient
   client = RhetorClient()
   ```

2. **Test each component:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest Engram/tests/
   python -m pytest Metis/tests/
   python -m pytest Sophia/tests/
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Merge branch when ready:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge remove-llm-adapters
   ```

## 📊 Statistics

- **Files modified/deleted:** 37
- **Lines removed:** ~10,000
- **Remaining references:** ~96 (mostly in commented code or strings)

## 🎯 Impact

This cleanup removes the redundant LLM adapter layer since all components now properly use Rhetor for LLM interactions. This simplifies the architecture and reduces maintenance burden.
