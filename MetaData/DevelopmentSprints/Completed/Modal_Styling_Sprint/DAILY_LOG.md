# Daily Log - Modal Styling Sprint

## Day 1 - [Date]

### Planning Session with Casey
- Identified need for professional modal styling
- Discussed replacing native alerts/confirms
- Agreed on dark theme consistency
- Defined three-phase approach

### Key Decisions
- Use CSS custom properties for maximum flexibility
- Implement backdrop blur for modern feel
- Create promise-based API for confirm modals
- Focus on accessibility from the start

### Architecture Notes
- Modal factory pattern for consistent creation
- Event delegation for dynamic modals
- Queue system for handling multiple alerts
- Z-index management for proper layering

### Files Identified for Changes
- Found 5 components using native alerts
- Identified 3 different modal styling patterns
- Need to consolidate into single system

## Day 2 - 2025-08-11 (Cari-ci)

### Progress
- [x] Created modal system foundation (modal-system.css)
- [x] Implemented modal factory (modal-factory.js)
- [x] Added files to index.html
- [x] Created test page (test-modal-system.html)

### Observations
- Existing pattern uses HTML injection via innerHTML - very clean, no DOM manipulation
- Found 39 alert() calls and 2 confirm() calls in tekton-component.html alone
- Three different modal styles already exist (error, output, generic)
- Current modals already use CSS custom properties for theming

### Key Implementation Details
- Followed HTML injection pattern: createElement → innerHTML → appendChild
- CSS-first approach with all styling in classes
- Promise-based API for async operations (confirm, prompt)
- Event delegation for all button handling
- Golden accent (#FFD700) as specified, with hover state (#FFA500)
- 200ms smooth animations using CSS keyframes
- Backdrop blur effect for modern feel
- Z-index stacking for multiple modals

### Solutions
- Used single event listener per modal for all interactions (CSS-first pattern)
- No DOM manipulation after creation - purely static HTML injection
- Focus management using tabindex and .focus() for accessibility

## Day 3 - 2025-08-11 (Cari-ci continued)

### Progress
- [x] Replaced ALL native dialogs across the codebase
- [x] Tested async operations with promise-based confirms

### Phase 2 Completion Stats
- Total alert() calls replaced: 156
- Total confirm() calls replaced: 15
- Components updated: 13
- Functions made async: 12 (to handle confirm dialogs)

### Modal Type Distribution
- TektonModal.success(): ~40 uses
- TektonModal.error(): ~75 uses  
- TektonModal.warning(): ~25 uses
- TektonModal.info(): ~30 uses
- TektonModal.confirm(): 15 uses

### Notes
- All replacements follow the HTML injection pattern
- No DOM manipulation used
- CSS-first approach maintained throughout
- Functions with confirm() properly converted to async/await
