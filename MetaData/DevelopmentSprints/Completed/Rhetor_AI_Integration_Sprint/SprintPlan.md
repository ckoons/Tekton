# Rhetor CI Integration Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Rhetor CI Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple CI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on extending Rhetor to manage dedicated CI instances for each Tekton component and integrating these CIs with Hephaestus UI chat interfaces.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Component CI Management**: Implement dedicated CI instances for each Tekton component with intelligent model selection and assignment
2. **Prompt Engineering Pipeline**: Create stdin/stdout interception for transparent prompt enhancement and response processing
3. **Hephaestus Integration**: Enable component-specific chat interfaces with CI personality and context management
4. **Team Chat Moderation**: Implement Rhetor-moderated team chat where all component CIs can communicate with the human-in-the-loop

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Specialized CI Assistance**: Each component gets an CI optimized for its specific domain and tasks
- **Improved User Experience**: Natural, context-aware conversations with component-specific knowledge
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent model selection based on task complexity and budget constraints
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Team chat enables cross-component CI collaboration with human oversight

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Rhetor currently provides:
- Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama)
- Model routing based on task types and component configurations
- Context management with windowing and persistence
- Budget tracking and enforcement
- Template and prompt management

Hephaestus UI provides:
- Component-specific chat interfaces (tabs within each component)
- Shared chat interface module with streaming support
- WebSocket connection to Rhetor for LLM interactions
- Global hermesConnector for all components

### Pain Points

- All components share the same global LLM connection without specialization
- No component-specific prompt engineering or context management
- Limited CI personality differentiation between components
- No cross-component CI communication channel
- Manual model selection rather than intelligent assignment

## Proposed Approach

We will extend Rhetor with a Component CI Manager that creates and manages dedicated CI instances for each Tekton component. These CIs will have:
- Component-specific model assignments based on task requirements
- Transparent prompt engineering through filter chains
- Persistent context management per component
- Specialized personalities and system prompts

### Key Components Affected

- **Rhetor**: New ComponentAIManager, filter system, enhanced WebSocket protocol
- **Hephaestus**: Updated chat interfaces to use component-specific endpoints
- **All Tekton Components**: Will receive dedicated CI assistants through their chat interfaces

### Technical Approach

1. **Component CI Registry**: Create CI instances with model configurations optimized for each component's domain
2. **Filter Chain Architecture**: Implement stdin/stdout filters for prompt engineering and response processing
3. **Enhanced Protocol**: Extend WebSocket protocol to support component-specific CI routing
4. **Team Chat Channel**: Create a moderated channel for AI-to-CI and AI-to-human communication

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Component CI configurations with rationale for model selection
- Filter chain documentation with examples
- API contracts for new WebSocket message types
- Integration guide for component developers

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for ComponentAIManager and filter chains
- Integration tests for WebSocket protocol extensions
- End-to-end tests for component chat interactions
- Performance tests for concurrent CI instances

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Custom model fine-tuning or training
- Voice or multimodal CI capabilities
- External CI service integrations beyond current providers
- Autonomous CI actions without human approval

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Existing Rhetor infrastructure (model router, context manager, etc.)
- Hephaestus shared chat interface module
- WebSocket connection infrastructure
- Current LLM provider integrations

|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Model API rate limits | High | Medium | Implement request queuing and caching |
| Increased token costs | Medium | High | Use budget-aware routing and model selection |
| WebSocket connection stability | Medium | Low | Implement reconnection logic and fallbacks |
| Filter chain performance | Low | Medium | Async processing and performance monitoring |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Each Tekton component has a dedicated CI assistant accessible through its chat interface
- Component CIs demonstrate specialized knowledge and behavior for their domains
- Team chat enables effective AI-to-CI and AI-to-human communication
- All code follows the Debug Instrumentation Guidelines
- Documentation is complete with integration examples
- Tests pass with 80% coverage
- Performance impact is minimal (< 100ms added latency)
