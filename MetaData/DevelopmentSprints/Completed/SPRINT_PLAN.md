# Sprint: Ergon Rewrite - CI-in-the-Loop Reuse Specialist

## Overview
Transform Ergon from an agent builder into Tekton's CI-in-the-loop reusability expert and autonomous development orchestrator. Ergon will catalog, analyze, configure, and autonomously build solutions while learning from patterns to automate Casey's expertise.

## Goals
1. **Solution Registry**: Comprehensive database of tools, agents, MCP servers, and workflows
2. **CI-in-the-Loop Builder**: Autonomous development with graduated autonomy levels
3. **Workflow Learning**: Capture and replay Casey's development patterns
4. **GitHub Intelligence**: Deep analysis for reusability and adaptation
5. **Research Integration**: Contribute to multi-CI cognition studies

## Technical Decisions
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for evolutionary schema design
- Socket communication on port 8102 for AI pipelines
- StandardComponentBase for Tekton consistency
- CSS-first UI with zero DOM manipulation
- SSE for real-time progress updates
- Workflow memory using Engram integration
- Template-based code generation
- Model-agnostic design (socket principle)
- GitFlow for self-improvement PRs

## Key Principles
1. **Casey Automation First**: Every feature reduces human touchpoints
2. **Reuse Over Build**: Always prefer configuring existing solutions
3. **Progressive Autonomy**: Start supervised, evolve to autonomous
4. **Learn From Patterns**: Capture, analyze, and improve workflows
5. **Research Integration**: Contribute to multi-CI cognition studies

## Out of Scope
- Building new tools from scratch (focus on reuse)
- Complex AI model training (use commodity models)
- Version control system (use existing Git)
- Full IDE features (integrate with existing tools)

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Foundation & Core Architecture
- **Week 3-4**: Reuse Intelligence
- **Week 5-6**: CI-in-the-Loop Capabilities
- **Week 7-8**: UI Implementation
- **Week 9-10**: Learning & Evolution
- **Week 11-12**: Advanced Autonomy
