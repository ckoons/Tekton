# Merge Coordination Example Workflow

## Scenario: Three AI Workers Optimizing Engram

Let's walk through a real scenario where three Claude instances are working on different Engram optimizations simultaneously.

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Casey sets up three worker environments
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/casey/Tekton.git Tekton-worker1
git clone https://github.com/casey/Tekton.git Tekton-worker2  
git clone https://github.com/casey/Tekton.git Tekton-worker3

# Each worker creates their branch
cd Tekton-worker1 && git checkout -b sprint/optimize-vector-search
cd Tekton-worker2 && git checkout -b sprint/optimize-memory-storage
cd Tekton-worker3 && git checkout -b sprint/optimize-api-performance
```

### Worker Activities

**Worker 1 (Apollo)**: Optimizing vector search
```python
# Changes to engram/core/memory/storage/vector_storage.py
# Implements parallel search across vector databases
# Adds caching layer for frequent queries
```

**Worker 2 (Athena)**: Optimizing memory storage
```python
# Changes to engram/core/memory/storage/vector_storage.py
# Implements batch processing for storage operations
# Adds compression for large memories
```

**Worker 3 (Numa)**: Optimizing API performance
```python
# Changes to engram/api/v1/endpoints.py
# Implements response streaming
# Adds request queuing system
```

### Timeline of Events

#### T+0: Workers Complete Their Tasks

```bash
# Worker 1 signals completion
cd Tekton-worker1
git add .
git commit -m "Optimized vector search with parallel processing

READY_TO_MERGE"
git push origin sprint/optimize-vector-search

# Worker 2 signals completion (2 minutes later)
cd Tekton-worker2
git add .
git commit -m "Optimized memory storage with batch operations

READY_TO_MERGE"
git push origin sprint/optimize-memory-storage

# Worker 3 signals completion (5 minutes later)
cd Tekton-worker3
git add .
git commit -m "Optimized API with streaming responses

READY_TO_MERGE"
git push origin sprint/optimize-api-performance
```

#### T+30s: Merge Coordinator Detects Ready Branches

```
[Merge Coordinator] Detected 3 branches ready for merge:
- sprint/optimize-vector-search
- sprint/optimize-memory-storage
- sprint/optimize-api-performance

[Merge Coordinator] Processing sprint/optimize-vector-search...
✓ Clean merge to main

[Merge Coordinator] Processing sprint/optimize-memory-storage...
✗ CONFLICT in engram/core/memory/storage/vector_storage.py
```

#### T+45s: AI Consensus Round 1

```
[Merge Coordinator] Initiating AI consensus for conflict resolution...

[Team Chat] MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION - Round 1

File: engram/core/memory/storage/vector_storage.py
Worker_1: Added parallel search with caching
Worker_2: Added batch storage with compression

Both modified the VectorStorage.search() method differently.

[Apollo]: Both optimizations are valuable. Parallel search improves read performance.
[Athena]: Batch storage is critical for write performance. My compression reduces storage by 60%.
[Numa]: Architecture perspective: We need both. Can we merge the approaches?
[Metis]: I can synthesize: parallel search for reads, batch processing for writes.
[Synthesis]: Proposing unified approach - see attached code.

Confidence: 72% (below threshold)
```

#### T+90s: AI Consensus Round 2

```
[Merge Coordinator] Round 2 - Seeking higher confidence...

[Team Chat] MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION - Round 2

Previous proposal: Unified approach with both optimizations
Concern: Method complexity increased significantly

[Apollo]: The unified method is 150 lines. Original was 50. Too complex?
[Athena]: Complexity warranted by 10x performance gain.
[Rhetor]: Could we split into search() and batch_search() methods?
[Numa]: Yes! Separation of concerns. Different methods for different use cases.
[Synthesis]: New proposal with separated methods - cleaner architecture.

Confidence: 91% (above threshold)
✓ Applying AI consensus merge
```

#### T+120s: Worker 3 Processing

```
[Merge Coordinator] Processing sprint/optimize-api-performance...
✓ Clean merge to main (no conflicts with updated main)

[Merge Coordinator] All merges complete!
Summary:
- 3 branches processed
- 2 clean merges
- 1 AI-resolved conflict (2 rounds)
- 0 human escalations
- Total time: 2 minutes
```

### Example: Human Escalation Scenario

Let's say the AI consensus failed after 3 rounds:

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Parallel Development**: Three workers optimizing simultaneously
2. **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**: AI consensus found optimal merge
3. **Fast Resolution**: 2 minutes from ready to merged
4. **Learning System**: Future similar conflicts resolved faster
5. **Human Wisdom**: Only involved for truly ambiguous decisions
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Workers learn from decisions

## Command Summary

```bash
# Start the coordinator
aish merge-coordinator start

# Check status anytime
aish merge-coordinator status

# Handle human decisions
aish merge-coordinator decide

# Worker signals readiness
git commit -m "Feature complete READY_TO_MERGE"
