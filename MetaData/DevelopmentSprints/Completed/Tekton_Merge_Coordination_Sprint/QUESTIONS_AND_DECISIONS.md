# Key Questions and Decision Points

## Implementation Questions for Casey

### 1. **Worker Authentication/Identification**

**Options:**
```bash
# Option A: Branch naming convention
sprint/worker_1_taskname  # Simple numeric ID

# Option B: AI name in branch
sprint/apollo_optimize_search  # Named workers

# Option C: UUID-based
sprint/worker_a7f3b2c1_taskname  # Unique but less readable
```

**Recommendation**: Option B - AI names are memorable and meaningful

### 2. **Merge Check Frequency**

**Considerations:**
- Too frequent: Unnecessary overhead
- Too infrequent: Delays in merge pipeline

**Options:**
- Every 30 seconds (recommended for active development)
- Every 5 minutes (for lighter workloads)  
- Event-driven via webhooks (most efficient but complex)

**Recommendation**: 30-second polling with option to configure

### 3. **AI Consensus Round Limits**

**Trade-offs:**
- More rounds = Better consensus possibility
- Fewer rounds = Faster escalation to human

**Recommendation**: 3 rounds default
- Round 1: Present conflict
- Round 2: Address concerns
- Round 3: Final attempt
- Then escalate to human

### 4. **Human Interface Design**

**Option A: Simple Terminal**
```bash
File: vector_storage.py
[A] Worker_1: Parallel caching
[B] Worker_2: Batch compression
Choice [A/B]: B
```

**Option B: Detailed Terminal**
```bash
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Full AI analysis with pros/cons       ║
║ Code diffs side-by-side              ║
║ Performance predictions               ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Option C: Web Interface**
- Rich diffs with syntax highlighting
- AI discussion history
- One-click decisions

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, build toward B

### 5. **Learning System Priorities**

What patterns should we track?

**High Priority:**
- Conflict types that always need human input
- Successful AI consensus patterns
- Worker specialization patterns

**Medium Priority:**
- Time-of-day merge success rates
- Code complexity vs conflict rate
- Performance impact of merge decisions

**Low Priority:**
- Individual AI voting patterns
- Stylistic preferences

### 6. **Deployment Architecture**

**Option A: Integrated with tekton-core**
```python
# In tekton_core/__main__.py
if args.merge_coordinator:
    start_merge_coordinator()
```

**Option B: Separate Service**
```bash
# Standalone service
python -m tekton.merge_coordinator.service
```

**Option C: Systemd Service**
```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python -m tekton.merge_coordinator
Restart=always
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, move to C for production

### 7. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**

**When to auto-merge vs escalate?**

| Scenario | Auto-Merge | AI Consensus | Human |
|----------|------------|--------------|--------|
| No conflicts | ✓ | | |
| Style differences | ✓ | | |
| Different approaches | | ✓ | |
| Architecture changes | | | ✓ |
| Security implications | | | ✓ |
| Performance trade-offs | | ✓ | Sometimes |

### 8. **Backup and Recovery**

**Backup Strategy:**
```bash
# Option A: Backup branch
git checkout main
git branch main-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Option B: Tag each merge
git tag merge-coordinator-$(date +%s)

# Option C: Full repo snapshots
tar -czf tekton-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .git/
```

**Recommendation**: Option B - Tags are lightweight and permanent

### 9. **Error Handling**

**What if merge coordinator crashes mid-merge?**

1. Transaction log for recovery
2. Atomic operations only
3. Health checks from tekton-status
4. Automatic cleanup on restart

### 10. **Performance Targets**

**Proposed SLAs:**
- Conflict detection: < 5 seconds
- AI consensus: < 2 minutes
- Human escalation: < 1 hour response time
- Total merge time: < 5 minutes (excluding human)

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Decision | Recommended | Alternative | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Worker ID | AI names | Numeric IDs | More meaningful |
| Check frequency | 30 seconds | 5 minutes | Configurable |
| AI rounds | 3 | 2-5 | Balance speed/quality |
| Human UI | Simple terminal | Web later | Start simple |
| Learning focus | Conflict patterns | All metrics | Prioritize value |
| Deployment | With tekton-core | Separate service | Easier to start |
| Backup | Git tags | Branch backup | Lightweight |

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Immediate**: Implement basic merge detection and clean merge handling
2. **Week 1**: Add conflict detection and AI consensus
3. **Week 2**: Human escalation interface
4. **Week 3**: Learning system integration
5. **Week 4**: Performance optimization and testing

## Risk Mitigation

**Highest Risks:**
1. Corrupted merges → Solution: Atomic operations, extensive testing
2. Infinite AI loops → Solution: Hard round limits
3. Lost code → Solution: Tag everything, backup branch
4. Human bottleneck → Solution: Good AI consensus, clear decisions

**Safety First Principle**: When in doubt, escalate to human rather than risk bad merge.
