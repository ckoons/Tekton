# Tekton and aish Development Handoff

## Summary
We successfully completed Phase 0 cleanup of the Tekton CI platform, removing all deprecated files and fixing critical issues in the shared services. The unified CI platform is now operational with all components using the generic CI specialist framework with the llama3.3:70b model.

## Completed Work

### Phase 0: Cleanup
- ✅ Removed all deprecated files including:
  - Old specialist_router references
  - Component-specific CI specialist files
  - Files with .deprecated extensions
  - Stale specialist manager code
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors from cleanup (try/except blocks, imports)
- ✅ Killed old CI processes running deleted modules

### Shared Services Fixes
- ✅ Fixed TOCTOU race condition in port allocation
- ✅ Added stale lock cleanup with 60-second timeout
- ✅ Fixed Path import issues in launcher
- ✅ Added CI config sync service to launcher/killer
- ✅ Ensured all CIs use generic specialist with llama3.3:70b

### MCP Tools Integration
- ✅ Removed dummy responses from MCP tools
- ✅ Replaced with NotImplementedError exceptions for:
  - SendMessageToSpecialist
  - GetSpecialistConversationHistory
  - ConfigureOrchestration

## Current Architecture

### CI Registry
- File-based registry at `~/.tekton/ai_registry/`
- Dual architecture support:
  - Greek Chorus CIs: Socket-based (ports 9001-9004)
  - Rhetor: API-based (port 8003)
- Registry client with proper locking and timeout handling

### Active Components
- **Hermes**: Message bus (port 8001)
- **Engram**: Memory service (port 8002)
- **Rhetor**: API gateway (port 8003)
- **Numa**: Resource monitor (port 8004)
- **Greek Chorus CIs**: 
  - Athena: Wisdom CI (port 9001)
  - Apollo: Vision CI (port 9002)
  - Dionysus: Creative CI (port 9003)
  - Hephaestus: Builder CI (port 9004)
- **CI Config Sync**: Background service maintaining registry consistency

### Generic CI Specialist
All CIs now use `/Tekton/shared/ai/specialist_worker.py` as base class:
- Socket server for Greek Chorus CIs
- Ollama integration (default)
- Anthropic integration via Rhetor
- Standard message handlers (ping, health, info, chat)

## Priority Tasks (Per Casey)

1. **MCP Implementation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Implement SendMessageToSpecialist for both socket and API communication
   - Handle routing based on CI type (Greek Chorus vs Rhetor)
   - Add proper error handling and timeouts

2. **Socket Parsing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Fix aish socket communication parsing for Greek Chorus CIs
   - Current issue: Socket responses may not be properly parsed
   - Need to verify message format and delimiters

3. **Streaming Support** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Implement SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses
   - Add to both aish and Rhetor API endpoints
   - Support partial response handling

4. **WebSocket Support** (Casey mentioned priority)
   - Review current WebSocket setup
   - Implement bidirectional communication
   - Add to aish for real-time interaction

5. **Session Management** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Implement stateful conversation tracking
   - Add session IDs and context persistence
   - Integrate with Engram for memory storage

## Technical Debt

1. **GetSpecialistConversationHistory**
   - Needs implementation using Engram service
   - Requires defining conversation storage format

2. **ConfigureOrchestration**
   - Define orchestration settings schema
   - Implement configuration persistence
   - Add dynamic CI routing rules

3. **Error Recovery**
   - No retry logic implemented (per Casey's instruction)
   - Need proper error propagation
   - Add monitoring/alerting hooks

## Key Files Modified

- `/Tekton/shared/ai/registry_client.py` - Fixed locking issues
- `/Tekton/scripts/enhanced_tekton_launcher.py` - Added sync service
- `/Tekton/scripts/enhanced_tekton_killer.py` - Added sync cleanup
- `/Tekton/Rhetor/rhetor/core/mcp/tools_integration_unified.py` - Removed dummy responses
- Multiple component files - Removed deprecated code

## Notes
- Casey prefers no auto-restart (it hides problems)
- Focus on making errors visible for debugging
- All CIs should show "Llama3.3 70B" in status
- Keep implementation simple and direct
