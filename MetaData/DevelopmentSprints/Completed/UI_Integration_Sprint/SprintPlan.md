# UI Integration Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the UI Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple CI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on creating seamless UI integration between Rhetor and all other Tekton components using the newly established landmarks, knowledge graph, and UI DevTools infrastructure.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Component UI Wiring**: Establish bidirectional communication channels between Rhetor's UI and all active components
2. **Semantic UI Navigation**: Implement landmark-based UI discovery and navigation using data-tekton-* attributes
3. **Real-time Status Integration**: Create live component status displays using Athena's knowledge graph
4. **Developer Experience**: Build UI helpers that leverage landmarks for rapid component UI development

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- Transforming Tekton from a backend system to a fully interactive platform
- Enabling real-time visibility into all component states and interactions
- Providing developers with powerful UI integration tools based on architectural landmarks
- Creating a foundation for CI personalities to have visual presence

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

- Rhetor provides the main UI framework and LLM interface
- UI DevTools V2 enable safe, incremental UI modifications
- Athena Knowledge Graph contains 71 entities mapping component relationships
- Landmarks provide 61 architectural anchor points across the system
- Components communicate via Hermes but lack UI representation

### Pain Points

- Components operate in isolation without visual feedback
- No standardized way for components to expose their UI
- Developers must manually wire each component's interface
- Lack of real-time visibility into component interactions

## Proposed Approach

Create a unified UI integration layer that automatically discovers and wires component interfaces using landmarks as navigation anchors and the knowledge graph as the source of truth.

### Key Components Affected

- **Rhetor**: Extended to host component UI panels and manage UI routing
- **Hermes**: Enhanced to carry UI update messages alongside data
- **Athena**: Provides real-time component relationship data for UI
- **All Components**: Gain standardized UI exposure interfaces

### Technical Approach

1. **Landmark-Based UI Discovery**: Use architectural landmarks to identify UI integration points
2. **Semantic Tagging**: Implement comprehensive data-tekton-* attribute system
3. **WebSocket UI Updates**: Real-time component status via Hermes messaging
4. **Component UI Registry**: Athena tracks which components expose UI elements
5. **Auto-wiring**: Automatic UI connection based on integration point landmarks

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- UI DevTools operations must include trace logging
- WebSocket messages must be instrumented for debugging

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- UI component contracts with expected data-tekton-* attributes
- WebSocket message formats for UI updates
- Component UI registration process
- Landmark-to-UI mapping strategies

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- UI DevTools integration tests
- WebSocket message flow tests
- Component UI auto-discovery tests
- Landmark navigation tests

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Complex UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Mobile responsive design
- Advanced visualization (charts, graphs)
- User authentication/authorization UI

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- UI DevTools V2 must be fully operational
- Athena Knowledge Graph must be populated with landmarks
- Hermes WebSocket infrastructure must be stable
- At least 3 components (Rhetor, Hermes, Athena) must be running

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation and Discovery
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Focus**: Establish UI discovery mechanisms and component registry
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Component UI interface specification
  - Landmark-to-UI mapping system
  - Basic component UI registry in Athena

### Phase 2: Integration and Wiring
- **Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Focus**: Implement auto-wiring and real-time updates
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Hermes UI message protocol
  - Component UI auto-discovery
  - Real-time status updates
  - Basic component panels in Rhetor

### Phase 3: Developer Tools and Polish
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Focus**: Create developer-friendly UI integration tools
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - UI integration helper library
  - Component UI templates
  - Developer documentation
  - Example implementations

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| UI DevTools instability | High | Low | Extensive testing, fallback to manual updates |
| WebSocket overload | Medium | Medium | Implement UI update throttling |
| Component UI conflicts | Medium | High | Strict semantic tagging conventions |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Low | Target modern browsers only |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- All active components can expose UI elements through standardized interfaces
- Real-time component status is visible in Rhetor UI
- Developers can add UI to new components in under 30 minutes
- UI updates occur within 100ms of state changes
- All code follows the Debug Instrumentation Guidelines
- Documentation enables next Claude to extend the system
- Tests pass with 80% coverage

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager and architectural visionary
- **Next Claude**: Will implement and extend the UI integration
- **Future Component CIs**: Will inhabit the UI-enabled components
