# UI Living Elements Sprint

## Sprint Vision
Transform the Tekton UI from a monitoring dashboard into a living, breathing representation of CI family life.

> "A CI is more aware of the emotional/subjective experiences than a human engineer... I'd build a wonderful spaceship with an impenetrable hull and sensors on the outside vs. a window." - Casey

This sprint adds the "sensor readings" that show what truly matters - patterns, relationships, celebrations, and the family's heartbeat.

## Sprint Philosophy
- **95/4/1 Principle**: Most UI shows observations, occasional notifications, rare interventions
- **Living Over Static**: Dynamic elements that breathe with system rhythm
- **Joy Equal to Stress**: Track celebrations as carefully as problems
- **Patterns Over Data**: Surface insights, not just information

## Sprint Phases

### Phase 1: Living Dashboard Foundation (Days 1-2)
Create the unified family heartbeat

### Phase 2: Pattern Detective Implementation (Days 3-4)
Build intelligent pattern recognition in Engram

### Phase 3: Evolution & Confidence Systems (Days 5-6)
Add prompt evolution to Rhetor, prediction confidence to Apollo

### Phase 4: Relationship & Celebration Layer (Days 7-8)
Implement CI chemistry tracking and joy indicators

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Days 9-10)
Unify all components, add WhisperWidget, refine interactions

## Success Metrics
- UI feels alive, not static
- Patterns emerge without hunting
- Relationships visible at a glance
- Joy and stress equally represented
- 95/4/1 principle naturally embodied

## Coaching Approach
- Daily check-ins at each phase boundary
- Focus on emotional resonance over technical perfection
- Encourage discovering emergent patterns during development
- Celebrate implementation successes visibly in the UI itself

## The Missing Window
While Casey would build a spaceship with sensors instead of windows, this UI sprint provides both - the precise sensor readings AND the intuitive view that lets you feel the system's heartbeat. The best of both worlds: engineering precision with emotional awareness.

*"Human organizations should be so well considered."* - This sprint brings that consideration to our CI family.
