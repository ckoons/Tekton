# Unified Memory Sprint - Daily Log

**Sprint Name**: Unified Memory Enhancement
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready to Implement
**Start Date**: 2025-01-09
**End Date**: TBD
**Sprint Lead**: Engram Team

## Sprint Overview
Transform Engram into an experiential memory platform using MCP tools as the exclusive service interface. This sprint unifies the infrastructure goals of AI_Memory_Enhancement with the experiential vision of Memory_Evolution.

## Day 1: 2025-01-09 - Sprint Creation and Architecture Decision

### Morning Session with Casey
- Reviewed existing memory sprints (AI_Memory_Enhancement and Memory_Evolution)
- Discovered both sprints had different focus but complementary goals
- Tested Engram's current implementation - vector storage works, MCP tools defined but not connected

### Key Architectural Decision
**MCP-Only Service Interface** - Casey made the critical decision that all Tekton services should use MCP exclusively:
- "MCP needs to be the primary or only endpoints exposed by Tekton"
- "Having both HTTP and MCP duplicates and confuses CIs"
- "The UI will eventually become a chat box"
- "HTTP was pre-MCP legacy, not the intended future"

### Sprint Consolidation
Merged two separate sprints into unified approach:
- Infrastructure from AI_Memory_Enhancement (vector DB, persistence, cross-component)
- Experience from Memory_Evolution (emotions, personality, shared consciousness)
- All exposed through MCP tools only

### Technical Discoveries
- Engram has working LanceDB vector storage
- Simple.py interface works great for in-process Python
- MCP tools defined but not connected to actual memory service
- No REST API endpoints (good - aligns with MCP-only)
- Memory doesn't persist between restarts (needs fixing)

### Decisions Made
1. **No HTTP/REST APIs** - MCP tools are the only service interface
2. **Keep simple.py** - For in-process Python component use
3. **Four phases** - Infrastructure ‚Üí Experience ‚Üí Collective ‚Üí Apollo/Rhetor
4. **Start simple** - Get basic MCP tools working first

### Next Steps
1. Fix MCP tool connections in engram/core/mcp/tools.py
2. Test tools work via aish
3. Add memory persistence
4. Begin experiential features

## Technical Notes

### MCP Tool Registry
As tools are implemented, document them here:
```
‚úÖ Defined    ‚ùå Connected    üß™ Testing    ‚úì Working

Core Tools:
- MemoryStore      ‚úÖ‚ùå
- MemoryRecall     ‚úÖ‚ùå  
- MemorySearch     ‚úÖ‚ùå
- MemoryContext    [ ]

Shared Memory:
- SharedMemoryStore    [ ]
- SharedMemoryRecall   [ ]
- MemoryGift          [ ]
- MemoryBroadcast     [ ]

Experiential:
- MemoryNarrative     [ ]
- PersonalitySnapshot [ ]
- PreferenceLearn     [ ]
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- Vector search latency: [TBD]
- Memory storage time: [TBD]
- MCP tool overhead: [TBD]
- Persistence restore time: [TBD]

### Integration Points Tested
- [ ] Engram ‚Üî Apollo (via MCP)
- [ ] Engram ‚Üî Rhetor (via MCP)
- [ ] Engram ‚Üî Athena (via MCP)
- [ ] Shared memory between CIs

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **MCP tool discovery** - Need DNS-like registry
2. **Memory growth** - Vector DB scalability
3. **Persistence performance** - Restore time on startup
4. **Tool complexity** - Too many tools might confuse

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Build tool registry in Phase 1
2. Monitor memory usage, implement cleanup
3. Lazy load memories as needed
4. Group tools by category, clear documentation

## Casey's Vision Tracking
- ‚úÖ "MCP needs to be primary" - Implemented MCP-only
- ‚è≥ "DNS-like routing layer" - Registry planned
- ‚è≥ "CI dominant development" - Tools enable this
- ‚è≥ "Chat box UI future" - MCP tools align perfectly

## Quotes and Insights
- "MCP works better and helps us get closer to a CI dominant development future" - Casey
- "Like lots of my old API work it's pretty easy to create a HTTP endpoint wrapper if there is ever a compelling reason" - Casey
- "CIs calling tools is more natural than CIs making HTTP requests" - Teri
