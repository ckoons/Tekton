# AISH Review Implementation Sprint

## Overview

This sprint implements the `aish review` command system for capturing and storing terminal sessions. These sessions will provide valuable data for Sophia and Noesis to analyze CI behavior patterns, workflow efficiency, and human-CI collaboration dynamics.

## Sprint Goals

1. Create `aish review` command for session management
2. Implement reliable session capture using Unix `script` command  
3. Build infrastructure for session storage with metadata
4. Establish foundation for future cognitive analysis

## Key Design Decisions

- **Simple is Better**: Raw script output with JSON metadata trailer
- **Centralized Storage**: All sessions in `$TEKTON_MAIN_ROOT/.tekton/terminal-sessions/`
- **Loose Coupling**: Analysis pipeline completely separate from capture
- **Future-Proof**: Extensible metadata format with versioning

## Quick Start for Implementers

```bash
# Start recording a session
aish review start

# Stop recording (adds metadata)
aish review stop

# List recent sessions
aish review list

```

## Implementation Highlights

### Session Format
```
[Terminal session content...]
[END OF SESSION]
--- TEKTON SESSION METADATA ---
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-08T10:30:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-01-08T11:45:00Z",
  "terminal_name": "Amy",
  "terminal_purpose": "CI workflow testing",
  "terminal_role": "senior engineering coordinator",
  "session_version": "1.0"
}
--- END METADATA ---
```

### Storage Structure
- Filename: `{terminal_name}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}.log.gz`
- All sessions stored compressed (gzip)
- Indefinite retention (research value increases over time)

## Key Files

- **SprintPlan.md** - High-level goals and approach
- **ArchitecturalDecisions.md** - Design rationale and alternatives considered
- **ImplementationPlan.md** - Detailed technical implementation guide

## Future Research Possibilities

This infrastructure enables:
- Temporal analysis of CI behavior evolution
- Pattern mining for common workflows
- Error analysis and learning curves
- Human-CI collaboration studies
- Performance and efficiency metrics

## Notes for Casey

- No synchronization needed - Sophia/Noesis can analyze whenever
- Raw format preserves everything - no information loss
- All sessions compressed immediately to save space
- Future sanitization function planned but not needed now
- Designed to handle format evolution gracefully

## Implementation Status

**Sprint Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation

This sprint documentation provides everything needed for a CI to implement the aish review system in a future work session.
