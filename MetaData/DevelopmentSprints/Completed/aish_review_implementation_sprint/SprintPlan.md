# AISH Review Implementation - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the AISH Review Implementation Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple CI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on implementing a terminal session capture and review system that enables cognitive analysis of CI behavior and workflow patterns.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Implement `aish review` command**: Create a command to capture and store terminal sessions for analysis
2. **Session storage infrastructure**: Build a robust system for storing terminal sessions with metadata
3. **Analysis pipeline foundation**: Establish the groundwork for Sophia and Noesis to process session data

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- Enabling data-driven insights into CI workflow patterns and efficiency
- Creating a research corpus for studying CI behavior and evolution
- Supporting the development of better CI guidance and training approaches
- Facilitating the discovery of emergent patterns in human-CI collaboration

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Currently, Tekton has:
- A robust aish command system with inbox management and CI forwarding
- Terminal CIs (like Amy) that can handle coding tasks independently
- Sophia (wisdom/ML) and Noesis (discovery) components ready for analytical work
- No systematic way to capture and analyze terminal sessions

### Pain Points

- No visibility into terminal CI workflow patterns
- Unable to study how CIs evolve their approaches over time
- Missing data for cognitive research on CI behavior
- No mechanism to learn from successful CI sessions

## Proposed Approach

The implementation will consist of three main components:

### Key Components Affected

- **aish command system**: Add new `review` command
- **Terminal session management**: New infrastructure in `$TEKTON_MAIN_ROOT/.tekton/terminal-sessions/`
- **Terma terminals**: Integration with session capture using Unix `script` command

### Technical Approach

1. Use the Unix `script` command for reliable session capture
2. Append metadata trailer to each session file
3. Store sessions with clear naming convention: `terminal-name-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
4. Implement automatic compression for older sessions
5. Design for future extensibility (sanitization, different formats)

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Clear docstrings for the new aish command
- Usage examples in the command help
- Technical documentation for session format
- Notes on future extensibility points

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for session metadata generation
- Integration tests for the full capture workflow
- Tests for compression and storage management

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Actual analysis implementation by Sophia/Noesis (future sprint)
- Real-time session processing
- Session sanitization (noted for future implementation)
- Report generation or visualization
- Integration with Engram memory system

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Unix `script` command availability
- Existing aish command infrastructure
- TEKTON_MAIN_ROOT environment variable configuration

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 2 phases:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Implement `aish review` command and basic session capture
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Working `aish review` command
  - Session storage with metadata
  - Basic compression support

### Phase 2: Integration and Polish
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Focus**: Integration with existing systems and documentation
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Full integration with aish ecosystem
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Test suite

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Script command variations across Unix systems | Medium | Low | Test on target Mac platform, document requirements |
| Large session files filling disk | Medium | Medium | Implement compression and rotation early |
| Metadata format changes | Low | High | Design extensible format from start |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- `aish review` command successfully captures terminal sessions
- Sessions are stored with complete metadata in the trailer
- Compression works for older sessions
- Clear path exists for future Sophia/Noesis integration
- All code follows the Debug Instrumentation Guidelines
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Tests pass with 80% coverage

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager and primary user
- **Terminal CIs (Amy, etc.)**: Primary subjects of session capture
- **Sophia & Noesis**: Future consumers of session data
