# Daily Progress Log: Encoding_Storage_Retrieval_Sprint

## Day 1: September 8, 2025

### Completed
- [x] Sprint inception and design discussion with Casey
- [x] Created sprint directory structure
- [x] Completed SPRINT_PLAN.md with 4-phase implementation approach
- [x] Created comprehensive DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md capturing cognitive approach and conversation
- [x] Set up sprint templates (DAILY_LOG.md, HANDOFF.md)

### In Progress
- [ ] Phase 1: Cache-First Architecture Design (0% complete)
- [ ] Awaiting Casey's review of sprint plan and design approach

### Blocked
- [ ] Nothing currently blocking - ready to proceed with implementation

### Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use frequency-based promotion (2+ references) for cache->database routing
  - **Why**: Mirrors natural primate cognition patterns better than manual categorization
  - **Impact**: Need to implement access tracking in cache layer

- **Decision**: Implement unified interface that abstracts database complexity from AIs
  - **Why**: AIs shouldn't need to understand database architectures to use memory naturally
  - **Impact**: Requires query translation layer for each backend

- **Decision**: Focus on associative retrieval across multiple database types
  - **Why**: Enables natural "find everything related to X" queries that match cognitive patterns
  - **Impact**: Need context merger and latent space assembly systems

### Questions for Casey
- [ ] Should we integrate with existing Engram architecture or build as separate component initially?
- [ ] Which database backends are highest priority for initial implementation?
- [ ] Do you want this to eventually replace current Engram memory storage or work alongside it?
- [ ] Any specific performance requirements or constraints for the cache layer?

### Architecture Insights
- Cache-first approach solves the "impedance mismatch" between AI cognition and database operations
- Frequency-based promotion eliminates need for upfront data categorization decisions
- Associative retrieval enables natural memory workflows that match primate cognition patterns
- Interstitial hooks can make memory operations automatic rather than conscious

### Next Session Focus
- Begin Phase 1: Cache-First Architecture Design
- Implement cache layer with access frequency tracking
- Create storage decision engine for database routing
- Start unified interface design
