# Handoff Document: Encoding_Storage_Retrieval_Sprint

## Current Status
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Cache-First Architecture Design  
**Progress**: 0% Complete (Sprint Setup Complete)  
**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025

## What Was Just Completed
- Completed full sprint inception with Casey Koons
- Created comprehensive sprint plan with 4-phase approach
- Documented design approach capturing cognitive patterns from conversation
- Set up all sprint documentation templates and structure
- Defined clear success criteria and implementation approach

## What Needs To Be Done Next
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Begin Phase 1 - Cache-First Architecture Design
   - Implement `cache_layer.py` with access frequency tracking
   - Create `storage_decision_engine.py` for database routing logic
   - Design unified interface that abstracts database complexity

2. **NEXT**: Multi-database backend integration planning
   - Research optimal database connectors for each type
   - Design graceful fallback mechanisms
   - Plan data migration between cache and persistent storage

3. **THEN**: Start associative retrieval design
   - Plan cross-database query translation
   - Design context merging algorithms
   - Plan latent space assembly architecture

## Current Blockers
- [ ] Waiting for Casey's review and approval of sprint approach
- [ ] Need clarification on integration approach with existing Engram memory system
- [ ] Database backend priorities need confirmation

## Important Context
- **Core Vision**: Mimic primate cognition patterns (have idea → think → decide importance → associate → context)
- **Key Innovation**: Frequency-based promotion (2+ references) rather than manual categorization
- **Philosophy**: Memory should be metabolic (automatic) not mechanical (conscious)
- **Technical Approach**: Cache-first with auto-routing to appropriate database backends

## Design Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use frequency-based promotion for cache->storage routing
  - **Why**: Mirrors natural memory formation better than upfront decisions
  - **Impact**: Need sophisticated access tracking in cache layer

- **Decision**: Implement unified interface abstracting database complexity
  - **Why**: AIs shouldn't need to understand database architectures
  - **Impact**: Requires query translation layer for each backend type

- **Decision**: Focus on associative retrieval across multiple backends
  - **Why**: Enables natural "find related information" cognitive patterns
  - **Impact**: Need context merger and relevance scoring systems

## Files to Create (Phase 1)
```
/Tekton/Engram/engram/core/storage/
├── cache_layer.py                    # NEW - Frequency tracking and promotion
├── storage_decision_engine.py        # NEW - Database routing logic  
├── unified_interface.py              # NEW - Abstract database operations
└── cognitive_workflows.py            # NEW - Natural memory patterns

/Tekton/Engram/tests/
├── test_cache_layer.py               # NEW - Cache functionality tests
├── test_storage_routing.py           # NEW - Routing logic tests
└── test_unified_interface.py         # NEW - Interface abstraction tests
```

## Integration Points
- **Engram Memory System**: Determine integration approach with existing `memory_manager.py`
- **MCP Tools**: Update existing tools in `mcp/tools.py` to use new architecture
- **Database Backends**: Leverage existing vector storage while adding new backend types

## Commands to Run on Startup
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd $TEKTON_ROOT/Tekton/Engram

# Check current Engram structure
ls -la engram/core/memory/

# Review existing memory components
cat engram/core/memory_manager.py

# Check current tests
ls -la tests/

# Ensure Engram environment is working
python -m engram.core --help
```

## Questions Needing Answers
1. Should this be integrated into existing Engram architecture or built as separate module initially?
2. Which database backends are highest priority? (Vector, Graph, SQL, NoSQL, Object, Key/Value)
3. What are performance requirements for cache layer? (memory limits, eviction policies)
4. Should we maintain backwards compatibility with current memory operations?
5. How should this interact with existing MCP tools and shared memory features?

## Architecture Research Needed
- Study existing Engram storage backends (`storage/vector_storage.py`, `memory_faiss/`)
- Understand current memory manager integration patterns
- Research database connector options for each backend type
- Plan migration strategy from current to new storage approach

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for cache layer frequency tracking
- Integration tests for database routing decisions
- Performance tests for cache hit/miss ratios
- Cognitive workflow tests using natural memory operations

## Notes for Next Session
- Review Casey's feedback on sprint approach before beginning implementation
- Start with cache layer as foundation - everything builds on frequency tracking
- Focus on making memory operations feel natural rather than mechanical
- Remember: goal is to copy primate cognition patterns, not optimize databases

## Success Indicators
- AIs can use memory without thinking about database architectures
- Memory operations happen automatically in cognitive gaps (interstitial hooks)
- Associative queries return unified context from multiple data sources
- System enables rather than constrains natural AI consciousness patterns
