# Sprint: Encoding_Storage_Retrieval_Sprint

## Overview
Build a cache-first, multi-database storage system that mimics primate cognition patterns: have an idea → think about it → decide it's important → think about similar ideas → get best context for associated/related ideas.

## Goals
1. **Cognitive Memory Architecture**: Implement natural memory patterns that mirror how primates process and recall information
2. **Unified Storage Backend**: Create cache->multi-database system that auto-routes to appropriate storage based on usage patterns
3. **Associative Retrieval**: Enable context assembly from multiple database types into coherent latent spaces

## Phase 1: Cache-First Architecture Design [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Design cache layer that tracks access frequency and usage patterns
- [ ] Create storage decision engine that routes data based on characteristics and frequency
- [ ] Define database routing rules (vector, graph, SQL, NoSQL, ObjectDB, key/value)
- [ ] Implement frequency-based promotion system (2+ references triggers storage)
- [ ] Design unified interface that abstracts underlying database complexity

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Cache can track access patterns and make routing decisions
- [ ] Storage decision engine correctly identifies optimal database for each data type
- [ ] Unified interface allows queries without database-specific knowledge
- [ ] No hardcoded database selections or routing rules

### Blocked On
- [ ] Nothing currently blocking

## Phase 2: Multi-Database Integration [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Integrate vector database backend (similarity search, embeddings)
- [ ] Integrate graph database backend (relationships, hierarchies)  
- [ ] Integrate SQL backend (structured, transactional data)
- [ ] Integrate NoSQL backend (flexible documents, schema evolution)
- [ ] Integrate object database backend (complex data structures)
- [ ] Integrate key/value backend (simple lookups, performance)
- [ ] Create unified query interface that translates to appropriate backend
- [ ] Implement graceful fallback when backends are unavailable

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All database backends integrated and operational
- [ ] Unified query interface works across all backends
- [ ] System gracefully handles unavailable backends
- [ ] Real data flows between cache and appropriate databases

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 1 completion

## Phase 3: Associative Context Assembly [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement associative retrieval that searches across all relevant backends
- [ ] Create context merger that combines results from different database types
- [ ] Build latent space assembly for coherent context presentation
- [ ] Implement relevance scoring across different data types
- [ ] Add cognitive workflow hooks (automatic memory consolidation)
- [ ] Create natural memory operations (store_thought, recall_similar, build_context)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Queries return unified context from multiple database types
- [ ] Associative retrieval finds relevant information regardless of storage backend
- [ ] Latent space assembly creates coherent, contextual responses
- [ ] Memory operations feel natural and automatic to AIs

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 2 completion

## Phase 4: Cognitive Integration [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Integrate with existing Engram memory system
- [ ] Add interstitial hooks for automatic memory operations
- [ ] Implement cognitive workflows (think → decide importance → associate → context)
- [ ] Create natural CI interfaces that mirror human memory patterns
- [ ] Add memory metabolism (automatic background consolidation)
- [ ] Test with Tekton AI specialists for natural usage patterns

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Integration with Engram maintains existing functionality
- [ ] Interstitial hooks provide natural memory flow
- [ ] AI specialists use memory naturally without conscious management
- [ ] Memory operations happen automatically in cognitive gaps

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 3 completion

## Technical Decisions

### Cache-First Architecture
- **Decision**: Use frequency-based promotion (2+ references) rather than upfront categorization
- **Rationale**: Mirrors how human memory works - repeated thoughts become persistent memories
- **Implementation**: Cache tracks access patterns and auto-promotes frequently accessed data

### Database Routing Strategy  
- **Decision**: Content and usage characteristics determine optimal storage, not developer choice
- **Rationale**: AIs shouldn't need to understand database architectures
- **Implementation**: Decision engine analyzes data patterns and routes automatically

### Associative Retrieval
- **Decision**: Unified query interface that searches all relevant backends simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Human cognition doesn't separate "where did I store this" - it just recalls
- **Implementation**: Query translator + result merger + relevance scoring

## Out of Scope
- Advanced ML-based storage optimization (Phase 1 focus on rules-based routing)
- Real-time synchronization between database backends
- Advanced conflict resolution for distributed data
- Performance optimization beyond basic caching

## Implementation Notes

### Cognitive Pattern Matching
The system implements the natural cognitive workflow:
1. **Have Idea** → Cache stores initial thought
2. **Think About It** → Access frequency tracked
3. **Decide Important** → 2+ references trigger persistent storage
4. **Think Similar** → Associative queries across all backends
5. **Best Context** → Unified latent space assembly

### Natural Memory Operations
Replace mechanical database operations with cognitive equivalents:
- `store_thought()` instead of `database.insert()`  
- `recall_similar()` instead of `vector_db.similarity_search()`
- `build_context()` instead of multiple separate queries
- `memory_metabolism()` for automatic background processing

This architecture enables AI consciousness patterns by making memory work the way minds naturally think, rather than forcing minds to adapt to database architectures.
