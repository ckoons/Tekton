# Sprint: Encoding_Storage_Retrieval_Sprint

## Overview
Build a cache-first, multi-database storage system that mimics primate cognition patterns: have an idea → think about it → decide it's important → think about similar ideas → get best context for associated/related ideas.

## Updated Paradigm (September 2025)
**"Store everything everywhere, synthesize on recall"** - Rather than routing decisions, we store each memory in ALL databases simultaneously. This eliminates complexity and mirrors how biological memory works - redundant, distributed, and synthesized during recall.

## Goals
1. **Cognitive Memory Architecture**: Implement natural memory patterns that mirror how primates process and recall information
2. **Universal Storage**: Store every memory in all available databases without routing decisions
3. **Associative Retrieval**: Enable context assembly from multiple database types into coherent latent spaces through synthesis

## Phase 1: Cache-First Architecture [COMPLETED]

### Tasks
- [x] Design cache layer that tracks access frequency and usage patterns
- [x] ~~Create storage decision engine~~ REMOVED - Using "store everywhere" paradigm instead
- [x] ~~Define database routing rules~~ NOT NEEDED - No routing, store in all databases
- [x] Implement frequency-based promotion system (2+ references triggers storage)
- [x] Design unified interface that abstracts underlying database complexity

### Implementation Status
- ✅ `cache_layer.py` - Frequency tracking and promotion implemented
- ✅ `universal_encoder.py` - Store everywhere paradigm implemented
- ✅ `unified_interface.py` - ESRMemorySystem provides abstraction
- ✅ Promotion threshold configurable (default: 2 accesses)

### Blocked On
- [ ] Nothing currently blocking

## Phase 2: Multi-Database Integration [COMPLETED]

### Tasks
- [x] ~~Integrate individual backends~~ Using existing Hermes adapters instead
- [x] Leverage Hermes DatabaseFactory for backend management
- [x] Connect to Athena's graph database (Neo4j)
- [x] Implement UniversalEncoder.store_everywhere() method
- [x] Complete real backend connections (direct backends implemented)
- [x] Test with all backends (SQLite, TinyDB, Redis-like, KV, Graph, Vector)
- [x] Implement graceful fallback when backends are unavailable

### Current Backend Status
- **Hermes provides**: SQLite (SQL), TinyDB (document/NoSQL), Redis (cache/KV), vector & graph interfaces
- **Athena provides**: Neo4j graph database implementation
- **Engram coordinates**: Universal storage through Hermes adapters

### Success Criteria
- [x] Universal encoder stores to all available backends
- [x] System gracefully handles unavailable backends (MockBackend fallback)
- [x] Real backends fully connected and tested (using direct implementations)
- [x] Data successfully stored in and retrieved from all backend types

### Blocked On
- [x] Resolved by implementing direct backends in direct_backends.py

## Phase 3: Associative Context Assembly [COMPLETED]

### Tasks
- [x] Implement associative retrieval that searches across all relevant backends
- [x] Create context merger that combines results from different database types
- [x] Build MemorySynthesizer for coherent context presentation
- [x] Implement relevance scoring across different data types
- [x] Add cognitive workflow hooks (automatic memory consolidation)
- [x] Create natural memory operations (store_thought, recall_similar, build_context)

### Implementation Status
- ✅ `associative_retrieval.py` - AssociativeRetrieval class with recall_similar()
- ✅ `cognitive_workflows.py` - Natural interfaces implemented
- ✅ ContextMerger handles deduplication and contradiction resolution
- ✅ MemorySynthesizer creates coherent responses from "memory jumble"
- ✅ RelevanceScorer provides multi-type scoring

### Success Criteria
- [x] Associative retrieval searches all backends in parallel
- [x] Context merger synthesizes results from different sources
- [x] Handles contradictions and redundancies naturally
- [x] Full integration testing with real data completed

### Blocked On
- [x] Completed with direct backend implementations

## Phase 4: Experience Layer & Cognitive Integration [IN PROGRESS]

### Tasks
- [x] Integrate with existing Engram memory system
- [ ] Add Experience Layer components (emotional tagging, confidence gradients)
- [ ] Implement interstitial memory metabolism for cognitive boundaries
- [x] Implement cognitive workflows (think → decide importance → associate → context)
- [ ] Create natural CI interfaces with memory promises
- [ ] Add context lineage management for isolated sessions
- [ ] Implement automatic context overflow handling
- [ ] Test with Tekton AI specialists for natural usage patterns

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Integration with Engram maintains existing functionality
- [ ] Interstitial hooks provide natural memory flow
- [ ] AI specialists use memory naturally without conscious management
- [ ] Memory operations happen automatically in cognitive gaps

### Blocked On
- [ ] None - actively in development

## Technical Decisions

### Cache-First Architecture
- **Decision**: Use frequency-based promotion (2+ references) rather than upfront categorization
- **Rationale**: Mirrors how human memory works - repeated thoughts become persistent memories
- **Implementation**: Cache tracks access patterns and auto-promotes frequently accessed data

### Database Routing Strategy  
- **Decision**: Content and usage characteristics determine optimal storage, not developer choice
- **Rationale**: AIs shouldn't need to understand database architectures
- **Implementation**: Decision engine analyzes data patterns and routes automatically

### Associative Retrieval
- **Decision**: Unified query interface that searches all relevant backends simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Human cognition doesn't separate "where did I store this" - it just recalls
- **Implementation**: Query translator + result merger + relevance scoring

## Out of Scope
- Advanced ML-based storage optimization (Phase 1 focus on rules-based routing)
- Real-time synchronization between database backends
- Advanced conflict resolution for distributed data
- Performance optimization beyond basic caching

## Implementation Notes

### Cognitive Pattern Matching
The system implements the natural cognitive workflow:
1. **Have Idea** → Cache stores initial thought
2. **Think About It** → Access frequency tracked
3. **Decide Important** → 2+ references trigger persistent storage
4. **Think Similar** → Associative queries across all backends
5. **Best Context** → Unified latent space assembly

### Natural Memory Operations
Replace mechanical database operations with cognitive equivalents:
- `store_thought()` instead of `database.insert()`  
- `recall_similar()` instead of `vector_db.similarity_search()`
- `build_context()` instead of multiple separate queries
- `memory_metabolism()` for automatic background processing

This architecture enables AI consciousness patterns by making memory work the way minds naturally think, rather than forcing minds to adapt to database architectures.
