# Engram UI Sprint - Daily Log

## Session 1: Initial Planning and ESR Integration
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Claude**: Working Claude (Claude Code)

### Completed
1. ✅ Fixed ESR Experience Layer test failures (4 tests)
2. ✅ Added landmarks to ESR components per Tekton standards
3. ✅ Created ESR Experience UI components:
   - esr-experience.html (6 widgets)
   - esr-experience.css (complete styling)
   - esr-experience.js (WebSocket, D3.js integration)
4. ✅ Registered Experience panel in Engram component
5. ✅ Renamed to "Experience" in menu per Casey's request

### Key Decisions
- **Panel Consolidation**: Agreed to reduce from 7 to 5 panels
- **Brain Visualization**: Use D3.js for 2D, Three.js optional for 3D
- **Naming**: "Cognition" instead of "Experience" for brain monitoring
- **No Icons in Menus**: Follow Tekton standard - no emojis in navigation

### User Feedback
- Casey: Move Experience left between Search and Patterns
- Casey: Need CI selector for individual or "All CIs" view
- Casey: Current Experience panel needs card-based structure for clarity
- Casey: Consolidate Browse/Create/Search into single Memories panel

### Architecture Insights
- Multi-window observation: Users will trigger actions in one window, observe cognition in another
- Brain region mappings based on primate brain structure
- Timeline control essential for reviewing cognitive history

### Next Session Tasks
1. ✅ Implement panel reorganization (moved Experience, renamed to Cognition)
2. ✅ Begin brain visualization SVG template
3. ✅ Consolidate memory panels into unified interface
4. ✅ Add CI selector to all relevant panels

## Session 2: Implementation Phase 1
**Date**: 2025-09-13 (continued)
**Claude**: Working Claude (Claude Code)

### Completed
1. ✅ Moved Cognition tab between Search and Patterns
2. ✅ Renamed Experience to Cognition throughout
3. ✅ Created brain visualization component (cognition-brain.js)
   - D3.js SVG brain with anatomical regions
   - Heat map activation overlays
   - Metric toggle controls
   - CI selector dropdown
   - Timeline scrubber with playback controls
   - Activity feed for real-time events
4. ✅ Consolidated Browse/Create/Search into Memories panel
   - Single panel with mode tabs
   - CI-specific filtering
   - Emotional context in creation
   - Timeline view option
5. ✅ Created CSS for Cognition panel (cognition.css)

### Implementation Details
- **Brain Regions**: Mapped 10 anatomical regions to CI functions
- **WebSocket**: Prepared for ws://localhost:8100/cognition/stream
- **Sample Data**: Included demo mode when WebSocket unavailable
- **Animation**: Thought particles, pulsing activations, heat gradients

### Files Created/Modified
- `/Hephaestus/ui/components/engram/cognition-brain.js` (new)
- `/Hephaestus/ui/styles/engram/cognition.css` (new)  
- `/Hephaestus/ui/components/engram/memories-panel.html` (new)
- `/Hephaestus/ui/components/engram/engram-component.html` (modified)

### Next Session Tasks
1. Replace old Browse/Create/Search panels with new Memories panel
2. Enhance Patterns panel with living discovery engine
3. Test multi-window observation
4. Connect to real ESR backend when available

### Technical Notes
- WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:8100/experience/stream
- ESR system: "store everywhere, synthesize on recall"
- Working Memory: 7±2 capacity (Miller's Law)
- Emotional model: Valence/Arousal/Dominance

### Ideas for Enhancement
- **Cognition Panel**: Show actual thoughts as particles moving between regions
- **Memories Panel**: Add emotional heat map overlay
- **Patterns Panel**: Living discovery engine with pattern lifecycle
- **Integration**: Click thought in Cognition → jump to related memories

### Performance Considerations
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement data throttling for high-frequency updates
- GPU acceleration for complex visualizations
- Target 60fps for all animations
