# Daily Log - Ergon DevOps Sprint

## Planning Session - Day 1
**Date**: January 9, 2025

### Discussion with Casey
- Reviewed Docker integration requirements
- Casey shared DevOps toolkit history (JSON cookbooks since 2007)
- Decided on phased approach with stop point after Phase 3
- Key insight: Container CIs provide intelligence at container level
- Casey Method: Deterministic, bottom-up deployment proven at scale

### Key Decisions
- Phase 1-3 for immediate implementation
- Phase 4-5 for future (2025-2026)
- JSON manifest as foundation
- Container CIs as Tekton's novel contribution
- Keep complexity low until actually needed

### Historical Context
- Casey's cookbooks predate modern DevOps tools
- Proven at companies of every size
- AWS Windows deployment story (Internap registry solution)
- Preference for C over Python for deterministic execution
- Simple > Complex (Kubernetes criticism valid)

---

## Phase 1 Implementation - Day 2
**Date**: [TBD]

### Tasks Completed
- [ ] Docker button added to project cards
- [ ] Dockerfile generation endpoint created
- [ ] Project CI integration working

### Code Snippets
```javascript
// Docker button implementation
<button onclick="generateDockerImage('${project.id}')" 
        class="tekton__project-action-btn">
    üê≥ Docker
</button>
```

### Challenges
- [Document any challenges]

### Notes
- [Important observations]

---

## Phase 2 Implementation - Day 3
**Date**: [TBD]

### Container CI Development
- [ ] Base ContainerCI class implemented
- [ ] Service detection working
- [ ] aish registration successful

### Test Results
```bash
# Container CI communication test
aish webapp-container-ci "What's your status?"
> "Running nginx (port 80), python (port 8000), redis (port 6379). 
> Memory at 45%, all services healthy."
```

### Architecture Notes
- Container CI as "consciousness" of container
- Self-aware, self-managing design
- Understands role via manifest

---

## Phase 3 Implementation - Day 4
**Date**: [TBD]

### JSON Manifest System
- [ ] Manifest schema v1.0 defined
- [ ] DeterministicPackager implemented
- [ ] Hash calculation working

### Manifest Example
```json
{
  "manifest_version": "1.0",
  "applications": {
    "api": {
      "type": "fastapi",
      "entrypoint": "main.py"
    }
  },
  "containers": {
    "api-server": {
      "applications": ["api"],
      "ci_capabilities": ["health", "optimize"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Deterministic Build Test
- Same manifest ‚Üí Same hash ‚úì
- Build reproducibility confirmed ‚úì
- Registry tracking operational ‚úì

---

## Phase 3 Completion - Day 5
**Date**: [TBD]

### Final Integration
- [ ] All Phase 1-3 components integrated
- [ ] End-to-end test successful
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Stop Point Evaluation
- Phase 1-3 provides solid foundation
- Container CIs are genuinely novel
- JSON manifest enables future expansion
- System remains simple and maintainable

### Metrics
- Lines of code: [TBD]
- Test coverage: [TBD]
- Components created: 3 major systems
- Integration points: 5

---

## Future Planning (Phases 4-5)
**Date**: [TBD - 2025/2026]

### Phase 4 Preview (Sites, Stages, Lifecycle)
- Extends manifest with lifecycle
- Adds site awareness
- Implements progression rules
- Casey Method checkpoint system

### Phase 5 Preview (Federation)
- Multiple Tekton stacks
- Cookbook partitioning
- Geographic distribution
- Menu of the Day synchronization

### Casey's Guidance
"Keep it simple. What we have in Phase 1-3 is cool enough. 
The foundation is solid. We'll build the full system when needed."

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Phased approach with clear stop points
- JSON manifest as foundation
- Container CI concept resonates
- Casey Method principles applied

### What We Learned
- Simplicity beats complexity
- Deterministic > Flexible
- Proven patterns > New frameworks
- Container-level intelligence is powerful

### Future Considerations
- C implementation for production?
- Federation protocol design
- Cookbook synchronization strategy
- Global registry architecture
