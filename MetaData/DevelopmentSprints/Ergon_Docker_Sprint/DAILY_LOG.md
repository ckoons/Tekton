# Daily Log - Ergon Docker Sprint

## Day 1 - Planning Session
**Date**: [TBD]

### Discussion with Casey
- Identified need for Docker integration in Tekton
- Decided on dual approach: Simple button in TektonCore, full management in Ergon
- Key insight: Container CI per container rather than per application
- Container CI acts as "container consciousness"
- Agreed on TektonCore reorganization to consolidate GitHub operations

### Architecture Decisions
- Container CIs will be self-aware and self-managing
- Each container gets its own intelligent CI
- Container CIs auto-register with aish
- Ergon manages Docker lifecycle
- TektonCore provides simple Docker image generation
- Hermes monitors container health

### Key Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: TektonCore for development, Ergon for deployment
- **Intelligence at Container Level**: Each container is self-aware
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add features as needed
- **CI Collaboration**: Container CIs can communicate with each other

## Day 2 - Phase 1 Implementation
**Date**: [TBD]

### Progress
- [ ] Added Docker button to project cards
- [ ] Created Dockerfile generation endpoint
- [ ] Integrated with project CI for analysis

### Challenges
- [Document any challenges]

### Notes
- [Important observations]

---

## Day 3 - Phase 2 Implementation
**Date**: [TBD]

### Progress
- [ ] Created Ergon Docker menu structure
- [ ] Extended solution registry for Docker

### Container CI Design
```python
# Key insight: Container knows its contents
container_ci.understand_contents()
# Returns: {
#   "web": "fastapi on port 8000",
#   "cache": "redis on port 6379", 
#   "db": "postgres on port 5432"
# }
```

---

## Day 4 - Phase 3 Implementation
**Date**: [TBD]

### Progress
- [ ] Implemented Container CI base class
- [ ] Added service detection
- [ ] Created health monitoring

### Container CI Interactions
```bash
# Tested container CI communication
aish myapp-container-ci "status"
> "Running 3 services: FastAPI (healthy), Redis (healthy), Celery (idle)"

aish myapp-container-ci "optimize memory"
> "Cleared Redis cache (freed 200MB), restarted Celery workers (freed 150MB)"
```

---

## Day 5 - Integration Testing
**Date**: [TBD]

### End-to-End Test Results
- [ ] Project → Docker Image → Ergon → Container → CI
- [ ] Container CI registration with aish
- [ ] Health monitoring via Hermes
- [ ] Status display in tekton status

### Performance Observations
- Container CI overhead: ~50MB per container
- Response time for CI queries: <100ms
- Health check interval: 30 seconds

---

## Sprint Retrospective
