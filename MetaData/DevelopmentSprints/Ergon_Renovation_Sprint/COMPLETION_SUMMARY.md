# Ergon Renovation Sprint - Completion Summary

## Sprint Overview
**Component**: Ergon - Agent builder, tools manager, and MCP connections hub  
**Completed**: January 21, 2025  
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours  
**Developer**: Teri/Claude (Coder-A)

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. CSS-First Navigation âœ…
- Converted all 6 tabs from onclick handlers to radio/label pattern
- Added hidden radio inputs for state management
- Implemented CSS rules for tab switching and panel visibility
- Removed all JavaScript-based tab switching code

### 2. Footer Visibility âœ…
- Fixed footer positioning to always be visible at bottom
- Added position: relative to container
- Footer uses position: absolute, bottom: 0, z-index: 10
- Content area has margin-bottom: 70px to prevent overlap

### 3. Real API Integration âœ…
- Updated API endpoints to RESTful conventions:
  - `POST /api/v1/agents` (was /agents/create)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/agents/{id}` (was /agents/delete/{id})
  - `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/run` (was /agents/run/{id})
- Service uses dynamic port configuration via window.ergonUrl
- Connects to Ergon backend on port 8102

### 4. Mock Data Removal âœ…
- Removed hardcoded agent cards (CodeAssistant, DataAnalyst, ResearchAssistant)
- Removed mock MCP connections (Claude API, OpenAI API, etc.)
- Removed static memory stats and tool listings
- Added dynamic loading with proper error handling

### 5. Real Data Loading âœ…
- Agent grid loads from `/api/v1/agents` with create/run/delete functionality
- Tools panel loads from `/api/v1/tools` showing enabled/disabled status
- MCP connections load from `/api/v1/mcp/connections` with real stats
- Memory panel connects to Engram service for memory statistics

### 6. Chat Functionality âœ…
- Updated chat code to work with radio button state detection
- Added proper error handling for missing AIChat service
- Integrated with aish MCP (port 8118)
- Both Tool Chat and Team Chat functional

### 7. Landmarks & Semantic Tags âœ…
- Added @landmark comments to all major sections
- All existing data-tekton-* attributes preserved
- Proper semantic tagging for navigation, panels, and footer

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/Hephaestus/ui/components/ergon/ergon-component.html`
- `/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/ergon/ergon-service.js`

### Key Changes
1. Added 6 radio inputs for tabs (agents, tools, mcp, memory, chat, teamchat)
2. Converted div onclick to label elements
3. Added CSS rules for radio-based navigation
4. Updated JavaScript to detect active tab via radio state
5. Added script includes for tekton-urls.js and ai-chat.js
6. Removed complex component script that interfered with CSS-first
7. Fixed footer positioning to always be visible
8. **Updated API endpoints to RESTful conventions**
9. **Removed all mock data and added dynamic loading**
10. **Connected to real backend services for all functionality**
11. **Added error handling and loading states**

### Unique Aspects of Ergon
- **Agent Management**: Create and manage AI agents for various tasks
- **Tools Configuration**: Enable/disable tools that agents can use
- **MCP Connections**: Manage Model Context Protocol connections to various AI providers
- **Memory Management**: Control agent memory and context retention
- **Dual Chat**: Both direct Tool Chat and Team Chat capabilities

## Testing Results
- Navigation: Working with CSS-first pattern
- Chat: Integrated with aish MCP for both Tool Chat and Team Chat
- Footer: Always visible as required
- Agent Management: Dynamic loading, creation, running, and deletion
- Tools Panel: Loads real tool status from backend
- MCP Panel: Shows real connection status and statistics
- Memory Panel: Connects to Engram for real memory statistics
- All 6 tabs: Accessible via CSS-first navigation with real data

## Patterns Followed
- Copied Terma's CSS-first navigation pattern exactly
- Followed Apollo/Athena/Hermes chat implementation
- Maintained BEM naming convention
- Preserved all semantic tags
- Kept agent-building functionality intact

## Next Steps
- Component is fully renovated and functional
- Ready for production use
- Agent creation/management features preserved for future enhancement
- Can serve as reference for other complex multi-tab components

## Notes
- Ergon was Casey's third project, designed for building agents pre-MCP era
- Future plans to repurpose as database of proven workflows and agents
- Component structure supports future transformations while maintaining current functionality
- Successfully handled 6-tab navigation (not 3 as initially thought)
