# Ergon Rewrite Sprint - Daily Log

## Day 1 - Planning & Design
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Session**: Initial Planning with Casey

### Completed
- [x] Analyzed current Ergon implementation
- [x] Identified need for complete rewrite
- [x] Defined new vision: Reusability & Configuration Expert
- [x] Created comprehensive design document
- [x] Set up sprint structure

### Key Decisions
1. **Complete Rewrite**: Current Ergon has database session issues, better to start fresh
2. **New Focus**: Shift from "agent builder" to "reusability expert"
3. **Four Core Functions**:
   - Database of existing solutions
   - Expert in reusability and configuration
   - Interactive expert system with Tool Chat and Team Chat
   - GitHub project analyzer
4. **Standard Chat Integration**: Include Tool Chat (Ergon CI) and Team Chat (shared)

### Technical Decisions
- Use StandardComponentBase for consistency
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible capability storage
- Template-based code generation
- CSS-first UI approach

### Next Steps
- Archive existing Ergon code
- Create new component structure
- Design database schema
- Begin Phase 1 implementation

### Notes
Casey's vision: "We should build reusable tools and simply configure or wrap them to do specific purposes"
