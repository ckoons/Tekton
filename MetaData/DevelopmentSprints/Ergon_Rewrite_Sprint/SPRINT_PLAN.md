# Sprint: Ergon Rewrite - Reusability & Configuration Expert

## Overview
Transform Ergon from an agent builder into Tekton's reusability and configuration expert - a component that catalogs, analyzes, and configures existing solutions rather than building from scratch.

## Goals
1. **Solution Registry**: Build a comprehensive database of existing tools, agents, MCP servers, and workflows
2. **Configuration Expert**: Create smart configuration and wrapper generation for reusing existing solutions
3. **Interactive Expert**: Implement conversational interface with Tool Chat (Ergon CI) and Team Chat integration
4. **GitHub Analysis**: Enable scanning external repositories for reusable components

## Phase 1: Foundation & Database [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Archive existing Ergon code to ergon_v1_archive/
- [ ] Create new Ergon structure with StandardComponentBase
- [ ] Design and implement solution registry database schema
- [ ] Create database models for solutions, capabilities, integrations
- [ ] Build capability taxonomy system
- [ ] Import existing Tekton tools into registry
- [ ] Set up basic API endpoints for CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement Hermes registration
- [ ] Create health and status endpoints

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Clean Ergon structure following Tekton patterns
- [ ] Database schema supports all solution types
- [ ] Existing tools imported and queryable
- [ ] Basic API tests pass
- [ ] Ergon registers with Hermes on startup

### Blocked On
- [ ] Nothing currently blocking

## Phase 2: UI & Chat Integration [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Create Ergon UI component in Hephaestus
- [ ] Implement Registry tab with search and filtering
- [ ] Build Tool Chat for Ergon CI interaction
- [ ] Integrate Team Chat for multi-component coordination
- [ ] Create solution detail views
- [ ] Add capability browsing interface
- [ ] Implement usage statistics display
- [ ] Add configuration preview panels
- [ ] Style with Ergon's color scheme

### Success Criteria
- [ ] UI displays real data from registry
- [ ] Tool Chat connects to Ergon's CI successfully
- [ ] Team Chat broadcasts work properly
- [ ] Search and filtering work efficiently
- [ ] No mock data in production UI

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 1 API completion

## Phase 3: Analysis Engine [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Build GitHub repository scanner
- [ ] Implement package.json analyzer
- [ ] Create requirements.txt parser
- [ ] Add go.mod support
- [ ] Design capability extraction algorithms
- [ ] Build dependency graph generator
- [ ] Create integration complexity scorer
- [ ] Add license compatibility checker
- [ ] Implement security vulnerability scanner

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Can analyze any GitHub repository URL
- [ ] Correctly identifies reusable components
- [ ] Accurate dependency extraction
- [ ] Complexity scores align with actual effort
- [ ] License conflicts detected

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 1 database schema

## Phase 4: Configuration Engine [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Create template system for wrappers
- [ ] Build FastAPI wrapper generator
- [ ] Implement MCP server wrapper builder
- [ ] Create agent configuration templates
- [ ] Build workflow composition engine
- [ ] Add configuration optimizer
- [ ] Generate test harnesses automatically
- [ ] Create documentation generator
- [ ] Build validation system

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Generated wrappers compile and run
- [ ] Configurations follow Tekton patterns
- [ ] Tests generated with good coverage
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and helpful
- [ ] No hardcoded values in templates

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 2 completion

## Phase 5: Expert System & Automation [0% Complete]

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement conversational solution finder
- [ ] Build capability matching algorithm
- [ ] Create proposal generation system
- [ ] Add autonomous building with approval
- [ ] Integrate with sprint planning
- [ ] Connect to Apollo for deployments
- [ ] Add Sophia monitoring metadata
- [ ] Create usage analytics
- [ ] Build recommendation engine

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Natural conversation flow for finding solutions
- [ ] Accurate solution recommendations
- [ ] Autonomous builds work correctly
- [ ] Sprint items created automatically
- [ ] Full integration with Tekton ecosystem

### Blocked On
- [ ] Waiting for Phase 4 completion

## Technical Decisions
- Use PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible capability storage
- Implement caching for GitHub analysis results
- Use template engines for code generation
- Build on StandardComponentBase for consistency
- Follow CSS-first approach for UI

## Out of Scope
- Building new tools from scratch (focus on reuse)
- Complex AI model training (use existing models)
- Version control system (use existing Git)
- Full IDE features (integrate with existing tools)
