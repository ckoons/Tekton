## Daily Rituals

### Morning Sync (15 min)
```bash
# Casey's morning check
aish tekton-core status         # Overall health
aish tekton-core assignments    # Who's working on what
aish tekton-core blockers       # Any issues
```

### Evening Review (15 min)
```bash
# Progress collection
aish tekton-core daily-reports  # All AI reports
aish tekton-core pr-status      # Ready for review
aish prometheus tomorrow-plan   # Next day planning
```

## Component Integration Schedule

### Week 1 Components
- **Hermes**: Message routing setup
- **Engram**: Project memory initialization
- **Terma**: Enhanced terminal discovery

### Week 2 Components
- **Prometheus**: Planning integration
- **Telos**: Requirements tracking
- **Metis**: Workflow orchestration
- **Apollo**: Code analysis setup

### Week 3 Components
