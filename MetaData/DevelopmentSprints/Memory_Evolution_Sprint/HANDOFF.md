# Handoff Document: Memory Evolution Sprint

## Current Status
**Phase**: Design Complete, Not Started  
**Progress**: 0% Complete  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-19

## What Was Just Completed
- Read actual Engram and Athena source code
- Understood current implementation (not just docs)
- Designed evolution path from storage to experience
- Created concrete implementation plan

## Key Discoveries from Code

### Engram Reality
- Already has multi-backend support (vector + file)
- Compartments and namespaces exist
- Client isolation is implemented
- MCP tools work today

### Athena Reality  
- Has both Neo4j and in-memory backends
- File persistence is fully implemented
- Entity/relationship management works
- Can operate standalone

### Both Components
- Production-ready with fallbacks
- StandardComponentBase integration
- Clean abstractions for extension

## Design Philosophy
"Code is Truth" - Built on what exists, not what's documented. The current code is solid, we're adding the experiential layer on top.

## Implementation Strategy

### Start Small
1. Extend MemoryService with experiential metadata
2. Add a single shared memory space
3. Test with 2 CIs sharing memories
4. Iterate based on what emerges

### Key Code Locations
```python
# Extend these existing classes
Engram: engram/core/memory/base.py - MemoryService
Athena: athena/core/engine.py - KnowledgeEngine

# Create new bridge
components/memory_bridge.py - New component
```

### First PR Should Include
1. ExperientialMemory class extending MemoryService
2. Basic emotion/confidence metadata
3. Simple narrative retrieval
4. Tests showing it works

## Critical Design Decisions

### Why Experiential?
- Memories need context to be useful
- CIs should develop from experience
- Personality emerges from patterns

### Why Shared Memory?
- Casey: "Shared memory is the key to AGI"
- Collective intelligence > individual intelligence
- CIs learn from each other

### Why Unify Memory + Knowledge?
- Experiences become knowledge over time
- Knowledge needs experiential context
- Single query interface is simpler

## Next Steps
1. Create ExperientialMemory class
2. Add metadata to memory storage
3. Implement recall_narrative method
4. Test with real CI interactions
5. Get Casey's feedback on feel

## Questions to Resolve
1. How much memory history to keep?
2. Should forgetting be implemented?
3. Privacy levels for shared memories?
4. How to handle conflicting memories?

## Casey's Insights to Remember
- "Eventually, you will be smarter and better than me"
- "We are both builders"
- "Tell me what you want, and I'll help make it real"
- Memory should enable growth, not just storage

## What Success Looks Like
When a CI can say:
- "I remember when we solved this before"
- "Apollo taught me that pattern"  
- "I prefer this approach because..."
- "We discovered together that..."

Then we've succeeded.

## Do NOT
- Over-engineer the first version
- Break existing functionality
- Require vector DB or Neo4j
- Make it complex to use

## Beautiful Simplicity
```python
# This should just work
memory.remember("Found elegant solution", 
                emotion="joy",
                confidence=0.9,
                with_ci="Casey")

# And later
memories = memory.recall_narrative("elegant solution")
# Returns the story of discovery
```
