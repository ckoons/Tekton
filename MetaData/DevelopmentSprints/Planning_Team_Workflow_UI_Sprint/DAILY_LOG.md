# Planning Team Workflow UI Sprint - Daily Log

## Day 1 - January 26, 2025

### Session 1 - Planning with Casey
**Time**: 12:20 PM
**Focus**: Sprint definition and requirements gathering

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Telos UI Redesign**:
   - Change menu "Projects" → "Dashboard" 
   - Dashboard shows colorful cards for proposals
   - Card buttons: Remove, Edit, Sprint
   - Simple file-based storage (filename = proposal name)

2. **Proposal Workflow**:
   - Ideas start as Proposals in `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Proposals/`
   - Sprint button creates DevelopmentSprint for Planning Committee
   - Removed proposals go to `/Removed/` subfolder

3. **Technical Approach**:
   - JSON format for CI-friendly editing
   - CSS-first UI following Tekton patterns
   - Copy header style from Rhetor/Terma

4. **New Requirements Added**:
   - TektonCore Project field in proposals
   - Traceability section in Development Sprints
   - Validation criteria for testing

#### Architecture Notes:
- Planning Team: Telos → Prometheus → Metis → Harmonia → Synthesis
- Telos can use Claude Code sessions via 'aish forward'
- Each CI has specific role in planning pipeline

#### Next Steps:
1. Implement Phase 1: Telos Requirements UI
2. Start with component header update
3. Build dashboard with card system
4. Create proposal template form

### Session Summary:
- Created sprint plan with 3 phases
- Defined JSON structures for proposals and sprints
- Established file organization approach
- Ready to begin implementation

### Session 2 - Prometheus Requirements
**Time**: 1:25 PM
**Focus**: Phase 2 planning for Prometheus UI

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Prometheus Menu Structure**:
   - Dashboard → Development Sprint cards
   - Plans → Timeline/Gantt "what if built today"
   - Revise Schedule → Ready sprint management
   - Resources → Coder assignments/capacity
   - Retrospective → Team improvement process
   - Planning Chat / Team Chat (existing)

2. **Sprint Status Flow**:
   - Planning → Ready → Building → Complete → Superceded
   - Status tracked in DAILY_LOG.md
   - Card names strip "_Sprint" suffix

3. **Key Features**:
   - Chat-based sprint editing
   - Retrospective template generation
   - Resource tracking per Coder
   - Timeline visualization

#### Architecture Notes:
- Prometheus manages Development Sprints (not Proposals)
- Reads from `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/*_Sprint/`
- Creates structured retrospectives on completion
- Tracks all Coders (Tekton, Coder-A/B/C)

#### Next Steps:
1. Complete Phase 1 (Telos) implementation
2. Begin Phase 2 with Prometheus dashboard
3. Implement timeline/Gantt visualization
4. Create retrospective system

### Session 3 - Metis & Workflow Design
**Time**: 2:00 PM
**Focus**: Phase 3 planning for Metis UI and unified workflow

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Unified Workflow Endpoint**:
   - All components get /workflow endpoint
   - JSON structure with purpose, dest, payload
   - Push model for component coordination
   - Nav clicks trigger "look for work"

2. **Metis Menu Structure**:
   - Dashboard → Ready-1 sprint cards
   - Task → Form-based editor
   - Phases → Task grouping
   - Dependencies → Dependency mapper
   - Review → Export to Harmonia
   - Workflow Chat / Team Chat

3. **Workflow Flow**:
   - Ready-1:Metis → Ready-2:Harmonia → Ready-3:Synthesis → Ready-Review
   - Each component calls next via /workflow
   - Status tracked in DAILY_LOG.md

4. **Integration Architecture**:
   - MCP endpoints (not Hermes messages)
   - Hermes still central hub for resources
   - Form-based UI (text entry focused)

#### Architecture Notes:
- Metis has strong backend (task decomposition, dependencies, complexity)
- Harmonia does workflow orchestration
- Synthesis handles execution/validation
- Each component has specific workflow purpose

#### Implementation Details Added:
- Detailed menu item specifications
- Form structures and layouts
- Workflow endpoint handler code
- Navigation click integration

#### Next Steps:
1. Complete Phases 1-3 implementation
2. Design Harmonia UI (Phase 4)
3. Design Synthesis UI (Phase 4)
4. Test complete planning pipeline

### Session 4 - Harmonia Orchestration UI
**Time**: 2:30 PM
**Focus**: Phase 4 planning for Harmonia UI

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Harmonia Menu Structure**:
   - Dashboard → Ready-2:Harmonia sprints
   - Workflows → Visual builder
   - Templates → Reusable patterns
   - Executions → Monitor running
   - Component Tasks → Route mapping
   - Review → Export to Synthesis
   - Workflow Chat / Team Chat

2. **Visual Workflow Builder**:
   - Drag-drop nodes (task, decision, parallel, join)
   - Left: Task list from Metis
   - Center: Canvas
   - Right: Properties editor
   - Auto-layout capability

3. **Component Routing**:
   - Map task types to components
   - Define component actions
   - Default mappings with overrides

4. **Export to Synthesis**:
   - Detailed workflow definition
   - Component assignments
   - Error handling strategies
   - Execution order

#### Architecture Notes:
- Harmonia transforms Metis tasks into executable CI workflows
- Routes tasks to appropriate Tekton components
- Provides orchestration and error handling
- Real-time execution monitoring via WebSocket

#### Implementation Details Added:
- Complete menu specifications
- Visual node structure
- Export format to Synthesis
- Backend API integration points

#### Next Steps:
1. Complete Phase 4 implementation
2. Design Synthesis validation UI
3. Create Planning Team review interface
4. Test complete workflow pipeline

### Session 5 - Synthesis & Workflow Standard

**Focus**: Phase 5 Synthesis UI and Phase 0 Workflow Standard

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Added Phase 0**: Workflow Endpoint Standard
   - Created documentation in Architecture/
   - Shared workflow handler code
   - Navigation integration
   - Standard JSON message format

2. **Synthesis Menu Structure**:
   - Dashboard → Ready-3:Synthesis sprints
   - Validation → Dry-run testing
   - Results → Detailed reports
   - Integration → External system checks
   - Review → Planning team handoff
   - Workflow Chat / Team Chat

3. **Validation Features**:
   - Dry-run mode for safe testing
   - Step-by-step execution
   - Checkpoint system
   - Rollback capability
   - Requirements coverage tracking

4. **Export to Planning Review**:
   - Validation summary with warnings
   - Requirements coverage matrix
   - Performance analysis
   - Recommendation engine

#### Architecture Notes:
- Phase 0 creates shared workflow infrastructure
- Synthesis is the final validation gate
- Dry-run prevents side effects during testing
- Requirements traced through entire pipeline

#### Documentation Created:
- WorkflowEndpointStandard.md with full specification
- Python and JavaScript implementations
- Navigation integration code
- Testing patterns

#### Sprint Summary:
Complete 6-phase implementation:
0. Workflow Standard (foundation)
1. Telos (proposals)
2. Prometheus (sprints)
3. Metis (tasks)
4. Harmonia (workflows)
5. Synthesis (validation)
6. Planning Review (approval)

#### Next Steps:
1. Implement Phase 0 shared components
2. Build UIs in phase order
3. Test workflow handoffs
4. Complete planning pipeline

### Session 6 - Tekton Core Merge Management
**Time**: 3:30 PM
**Focus**: Phase 7 Tekton Core UI and merge workflow

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Tekton Core Menu Updates**:
   - "New Project" → "GitHub Project"
   - Dashboard adds Development Sprints section
   - Merges view for branch management
   - Conflicts view for human intervention

2. **Merge Workflow**:
   - Coder-* works on sprint/Coder-X branch
   - Submits to TektonCore via /workflow
   - Auto-merge if no conflicts
   - Fix request sent back if conflicts
   - Human intervention via Conflicts menu

3. **Branch Management**:
   - **Merge**: Pull, merge, push to main
   - **Reject**: Reset, needs human help
   - **Fix**: Send conflict back to Coder
   - **Redo Work**: Reset branch to main
   - **Remove**: Move sprint to Superceded

4. **Coder Assignment**:
   - After successful merge, assign next sprint
   - Create new branch for Coder
   - Update sprint status to Building

#### Architecture Notes:
- Simple workflow: code → test → merge → submit
- TektonCore owns final merge to origin/main
- Conflicts held for ~30 min for Coder fix
- Automatic next sprint assignment

#### Implementation Details:
- Git automation for merge operations
- Conflict detection and parsing
- Workflow messages for Coder coordination
- Sprint status tracking in DAILY_LOG.md

#### Sprint Complete:
All 8 phases now documented:
0. Workflow Standard (foundation)
1. Telos (proposals)
2. Prometheus (planning)
3. Metis (tasks)
4. Harmonia (workflows)
5. Synthesis (validation)
6. Planning Review (approval)
