  "purpose": "Implement advanced memory indexing and retrieval with spectral analysis",
  "description": "Develop an enhanced memory system for Engram that uses spectral analysis techniques to improve memory indexing, retrieval speed, and pattern recognition. This will enable better context preservation and faster memory queries across the Tekton platform.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "Spectral analysis implementation complete",
    "Memory retrieval speed improved by 50%",
    "Pattern recognition accuracy above 90%",
    "Backward compatible with existing memory format",
    "Integration with all Tekton components"
  ],
  "requirements": [
    "Implement FFT-based spectral analysis",
    "Create memory indexing system",
    "Build query optimization engine",
    "Maintain backward compatibility",
    "Performance benchmarking"
  ],
  "notes": "This enhancement will significantly improve the AI's ability to recall and relate past interactions.",
