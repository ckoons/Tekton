  "purpose": "Implement landmarks in work products to create living documentation with institutional memory",
  "description": "Extend the landmark system beyond code into all work products (sprint plans, proposals, documentation). Create a three-layer system where code generates structural landmarks, CIs add semantic landmarks, and patterns emerge into suggested landmarks. This enables work products to become teaching documents that carry accumulated wisdom.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "LandmarkRegistry implemented with add(), suggest(), fire() methods",
    "CIs can naturally write landmarks in documents using @ notation",
    "Structural landmarks auto-generated at state transitions",
    "Emergent landmarks discovered from repeated patterns",
    "Work products become searchable by landmark type",
    "Knowledge graph visualization of landmark connections"
  ],
  "requirements": [
    "Hybrid approach: code-generated + CI-added + pattern-discovered",
    "Registry must be accessible from both code and CI contexts",
    "Landmark syntax must feel natural in documents",
    "System must track landmark usage patterns",
    "Must integrate with existing code landmark system"
