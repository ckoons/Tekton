  "notes": "Need to analyze specific Docker-like capabilities and workflows, build testable deployable units, don't deploy other than to Ergon sandbox; 'till' will need to search Ergon and find containers for deployment; this does not need to be Docker containers in other words we could have a Tekton container and that be a deployable unit but it's best to reuse Docker for our userbase",
