  "purpose": "Create a single-source-of-truth JSON-based configuration and deployment tool for Tekton Federation",
  "description": "Develop a lightweight C-based configuration tool that manages all Tekton deployments through a single JSON file. The tool implements a pull-based deployment model with granular HOLD controls, optional federation membership, and progressive trust levels. Based on Casey's proven 2006 infrastructure-as-code pattern, this tool provides complete deployment control without complexity.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "Single C program under 100KB compiled",
    "One JSON file contains complete deployment truth",
    "Pull-based updates every hour (configurable)",
    "HOLD mechanism works at all object levels",
    "Federation membership optional (solo mode supported)",
    "No external dependencies beyond standard C libraries",
    "GitHub PR-based validation for federation members",
    "Complete uninstall leaves no traces"
  ],
  "requirements": [
    "Implement hierarchical JSON object model (Sites, Containers, Stages, Services)",
    "Create pull-based deployment with 'menu of the day' pattern",
    "Build HOLD mechanism with who/why/when/what tracking",
    "Design shared/private configuration split for privacy",
    "Implement federation registration via GitHub PR",
    "Create trust levels (anonymous, named, hermes-registered, read, full)",
    "Build simple scheduler for 'Object HOLD on/off datetime'",
    "Add MCP interface for CI interaction",
    "Implement 'tekton systems status' for federation visibility"

  "benefits": [
    "Zero vendor lock-in",
    "Complete configuration visibility",
    "No hidden complexity or dependencies",
    "Respects user autonomy and privacy",
    "Proven pattern (deployed since 2006)",

  "notes": "This recreates Casey's 2006 infrastructure-as-code solution that remains superior to modern DevOps tools. The simplicity is the feature - one config file, one tool, complete control. The federation model follows Star Trek principles: voluntary membership, shared benefits, maintained autonomy.",
