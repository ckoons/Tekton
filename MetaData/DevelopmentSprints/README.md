# Tekton Development Sprints

This directory contains documentation and artifacts for Tekton Development Sprints.

## What is a Development Sprint?

A Development Sprint is a focused effort to implement new features, standardize components, or improve the Tekton ecosystem. Each sprint uses actionable checklists and clear handoff documentation to ensure continuity across Claude Code sessions.

## Simplified Sprint Structure

We've streamlined our sprint documentation to focus on **execution over documentation**:

```

    ├── SPRINT_PLAN.md          # What we're doing and why
    ├── DAILY_LOG.md            # Running progress/decisions
    └── HANDOFF.md              # Next session instructions
```

## Types of Sprints

### 1. Feature Sprints
Implement new capabilities or architectural changes.
Example: MCP_Distributed_Tekton_Sprint

### 2. Renovation Sprints  
Standardize components to follow current patterns.
Example: Component renovations using COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.md

### 3. Documentation Sprints
Keep documentation synchronized with code changes.
Run automatically after major changes.

## Sprint Execution Process

1. **Start**: Copy appropriate template to new sprint directory
2. **Daily**: Update DAILY_LOG.md with progress and decisions
3. **Handoff**: Update HANDOFF.md before ending session
4. **Complete**: Archive to Completed/ directory

## Key Principles

- **Actionable Checklists** - Every item is a specific task
- **Visible Progress** - Percentage complete for each phase
- **Easy Handoffs** - Next session knows exactly what to do
- **Minimal Documentation** - Only what helps execution

## Code Quality Requirements

All sprints must follow:
- No hardcoded ports/URLs
- TektonEnviron for all configuration
- Proper error handling and logging
- Real data in UIs (no mocks)
- Tests for all new functionality

## Current Active Sprints

- [Clean Slate Sprint](/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Clean_Slate_Sprint/) - Improving component reliability and isolation
- [Logging Clarity Sprint](/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Logging_Clarity_Sprint/) - Implementing standardized debugging instrumentation

## Completed Sprints

See the [Completed](/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Completed/) directory for documentation of completed sprints.

## Code Quality Requirements

All code produced in Tekton Development Sprints must adhere to our established quality standards:

### 1. Debug Instrumentation

All code must include appropriate debug instrumentation following the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

This instrumentation enables efficient debugging and diagnostics without impacting performance when disabled.

### 2. Testing

All code must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths

### 3. Documentation

All code must be properly documented:

- Class and method documentation with clear purpose statements
- API contracts and parameter descriptions
- Requirements for component initialization
- Error handling strategy

## Sprint Process Overview

1. **Inception**: Casey discusses a potential sprint idea with Claude
2. **Planning and Architecture**: Architect Claude creates detailed plans and architectural decisions
3. **Implementation**: Working Claude implements the code according to the plan
4. **Continuation and Handoff**: Working Claude prepares detailed instructions for the next phase
5. **Completion and Retrospective**: Working Claude finalizes all changes and creates a retrospective
6. **Merge and Integration**: Casey approves and coordinates the merge into the main branch
