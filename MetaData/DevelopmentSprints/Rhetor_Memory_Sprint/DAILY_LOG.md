# Rhetor Memory Sprint - Daily Log

## Day 1: August 29, 2025

### Session: Initial Planning
**Time**: 2:00 PM PST
**Claude**: Claude Code (Opus 4.1)

#### What Was Done
- Analyzed current memory system problems (memory bombing, no curation)
- Designed Apollo-Rhetor memory catalog architecture
- Created sprint plan with 5 phases
- Established hook-based integration approach

#### Key Decisions
1. **Memory as a Service**: Treat memory as a service CIs consume, not a burden they carry
2. **Apollo as Curator**: Apollo extracts and tags insights from CI exchanges
3. **Rhetor as Presenter**: Rhetor maintains catalog and optimizes injection
4. **Black Box CIs**: Use hooks to avoid modifying CI internals
5. **Token-Aware**: Strict enforcement of token limits with smart selection

#### Problems Encountered
- Current system has no size enforcement despite max_injection_size setting
- Memory dumping causes "prompt too long" errors
- No way to search or filter memories

#### Next Steps
1. Create memory catalog structure and schema
2. Implement basic storage backend
3. Start Apollo extractor patterns

### Technical Notes

#### Memory Item Schema
```python
{
    "id": "mem_[timestamp]_[hash]",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "ci_source": "ci-name",
    "type": "decision|insight|context|plan|error",
    "summary": "50 char brief description",
    "content": "Full memory content",
    "tokens": 450,
    "relevance_tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "priority": 0-10,
    "expires": "ISO-8601 or null",
    "references": ["mem_id1", "mem_id2"]
}
```

#### Hook Integration Points
```python
# Pre-message: Inject relevant memories
async def pre_message_hook(ci_name, message):
    memories = catalog.get_relevant(ci_name, message, max_tokens=2000)
    return format_context(memories)

# Post-message: Extract new memories
async def post_message_hook(ci_name, message, response):
    insights = apollo.extract(message, response)
    catalog.store(ci_name, insights)
```

### Handoff Notes
Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation. Start with memory_catalog.py.

## Day 1: August 29, 2025 (Continued)

### Session: Implementation Sprint
**Time**: 10:00 AM - 2:30 PM PST  
**Claude**: Claude Code (Opus 4.1)

#### What Was Completed

##### Phase 1: Memory Infrastructure [100% Complete]
- Created `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/memory_catalog.py` with full CRUD operations
- Implemented MemoryItem dataclass with all metadata fields
- Built MemoryCatalog class with search, filter, and persistence
- Added token counting and relevance scoring algorithms
- Created comprehensive test suite that passes all scenarios

##### Phase 2: Apollo Memory Extraction [100% Complete]  
- Created `/Apollo/apollo/core/memory_extractor.py`
- Implemented pattern matching for 5 memory types
- Built automatic tagging system for keywords and technologies
- Added priority calculation based on content importance
- Successfully extracts memories from CI exchanges

##### Phase 3: Rhetor Memory Presentation [100% Complete]
- Created `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/memory_presenter.py`
- Implemented token-aware memory selection and packing
- Built progressive disclosure (summary vs full content)
- Created formatted context injection strings
- Added REST API with 11 endpoints for memory management

#### Key Technical Achievements

1. **Smart Token Packing**: Algorithm fits maximum relevant memories within token budget
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring (recency 30%, context 40%, CI affinity 20%, priority 10%)
3. **Pattern-Based Extraction**: Regex patterns identify decisions, insights, errors, plans, and context
4. **API Integration**: Full REST API integrated into Rhetor enhanced app

#### API Endpoints Implemented
- `GET /api/memory/catalog` - List with filters
- `GET /api/memory/catalog/{id}` - Get specific memory
- `POST /api/memory/catalog` - Create memory
- `DELETE /api/memory/catalog/{id}` - Delete memory
- `POST /api/memory/search` - Multi-filter search
- `POST /api/memory/relevant` - Context-aware selection
- `POST /api/memory/cleanup` - Expire old memories
- `GET /api/memory/statistics` - Memory stats
- `PUT /api/memory/catalog/{id}/priority` - Update priority

#### Test Results
✅ Memory catalog: 8/8 tests passed
✅ Memory extractor: Successfully extracted 6 memories
✅ Memory presenter: Formatted within token limits
✅ API endpoints: Ready for integration testing

#### Problems Solved
- Fixed import issues with standalone testing
- Added proper enum handling for CI and memory types
- Resolved JSON serialization for datetime objects
- Fixed duplicate memory detection in extractor

#### Next Steps
1. Phase 4: Hook Integration in specialist_worker.py
2. Phase 5: Hephaestus UI with Memory tab
3. Testing with live Greek Chorus CIs
4. Migration from EngramMemoryManager

### Handoff Notes
Memory system core is complete and tested. Ready for Phase 4 hook integration. All files created and working. API accessible at `http://localhost:{RHETOR_PORT}/api/memory/*`
