# Response to Bari's Follow-up Questions

Perfect approach! You've got the right mindset. Here are the answers:

## 1. Backend Storage
**Let the backend decide!**
- The UI doesn't need to know or care about storage implementation
- The backend service (port 8106) should already have its storage strategy
- Just call the APIs - whether it's SQLite, PostgreSQL, or in-memory is the backend's concern
- Focus on the UI renovation only

## 2. Timeline Visualization
**Look at what's already there first!**
- Check if Prometheus already has a visualization library loaded
- If it has something working, keep it
- If you need to add visualization:
  - D3.js is already in use (I used it for Athena's graph)
  - Chart.js is good for timelines/gantt charts
  - But DON'T add new libraries if existing visualizations work

Quick check:
```bash
grep -i "chart\|d3\|vis\|timeline" prometheus-component.html
```

## 3. Quick Start - YES, START NOW!
**Begin Phase 1 immediately!**
- CSS-first navigation doesn't depend on backend decisions
- You'll get immediate visual progress
- Backend questions will resolve themselves as you work

## My Proven Order:
1. Add radio buttons at top
2. Convert onclick divs to labels
3. Add CSS rules for tab visibility
4. Fix the footer to always be visible
5. Remove onclick handlers from JavaScript
6. Test each tab switches properly
7. THEN worry about backend/data/visualizations

## Pro Tips:
- The hardcoded URL fix is good to do early (prevents errors)
- Test with `curl http://localhost:8106/health` first
- If the timeline already has a visualization, just preserve it
- Don't overthink - Casey's patterns are intentionally simple

Start Phase 1 now! You'll have working navigation in 30-45 minutes. ðŸš€
