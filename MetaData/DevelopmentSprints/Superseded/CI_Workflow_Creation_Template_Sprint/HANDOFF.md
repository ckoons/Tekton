# Handoff Document: CI Workflow Creation Template Sprint

## Current Status
**Phase**: Not Started  
**Progress**: 0% Complete  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-19

## What Was Just Completed
- Created sprint structure
- Defined workflow categories
- Outlined phases and deliverables

## What Needs To Be Done Next
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Start with Tool Usage Workflows (Phase 1)
2. **FIRST**: Create message routing debug workflow
3. **THEN**: Test workflow with real scenarios

## Current Blockers
- None yet

## Important Context
- This sprint emerged from Quality of Life sprint discussions
- Casey wants workflows for: development, research, automated CI engineering
- Focus on real problems CIs face, not theoretical scenarios
- Each workflow must be tested and proven to work

## Key Design Decisions
- Workflows should reduce CI guesswork
- Include actual commands, not abstractions
- Build from real error scenarios
- Make workflows discoverable via aish/playbooks

## Questions Needing Answers
1. Should workflows be accessible via `aish workflow [name]`?
2. Integration with Rhetor for workflow suggestions?
3. How to version/update workflows as tools evolve?

## Do NOT Touch
- Don't create theoretical workflows
- Don't add untested procedures
- Don't overcomplicate simple tasks

## Notes for Next Session
- Start by documenting actual CI pain points
- Test each workflow step in real environment
- Consider how CIs will discover these workflows
