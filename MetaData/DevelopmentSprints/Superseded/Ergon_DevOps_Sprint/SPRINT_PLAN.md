## Technical Decisions

### JSON Manifest Schema
```json
{
  "manifest_version": "1.0",
  "applications": {},
  "containers": {},
  "packaging": {},
  "lifecycle": {},  // Phase 4
  "federation": {}  // Phase 5
}
```

### Container CI Architecture
- One CI per container
- Auto-registers with aish
- Understands container contents via manifest
- Self-managing and self-optimizing

### Deterministic Packaging
- SHA256 hash of manifest + sources
- Reproducible builds
- Immutable container identity
- Registry tracking via hash

### The Casey Method Principles
- JSON cookbooks (proven since 2007)
- Bottom-up deployment (backend → middleware → frontend)
- GitHub as source of truth
- Hourly cookbook synchronization
- Site self-awareness
- Deterministic execution

## Out of Scope
- Kubernetes integration
- Complex orchestration (Phase 1-3)
- Production deployment automation (Phase 1-3)
- Multi-cloud management (Phase 1-3)
- Service mesh complexity

## Overview
Enable multiple Tekton stacks to discover, register, and communicate with each other as a federated network of CI systems.

## Vision
Treat entire Tekton stacks as CIs in the unified registry, enabling seamless cross-stack communication and resource sharing through MCP interfaces.

## Phase 1: CI Registration via Hermes

### Goals
- Implement self-registration protocol for individual CIs
- Enable entire Tekton stacks to register as units
- Use Hermes as the central registry service

### Implementation

#### 1.1 Registration Protocol
```python
POST /api/registry/register
{
    "name": "tekton-west-coast",
    "type": "tekton",  # New type for federated stacks
    "host": "tekton-west.company.com",
    "port": 443,
    "protocol": "https",
    
    # Tekton-specific fields
    "stack_id": "uuid",
    "mcp_endpoints": {
        "resources": "/mcp/resources",
        "tools": "/mcp/tools", 
        "prompts": "/mcp/prompts"
    },
    
    # Standard messaging
    "message_endpoint": "/api/federated/message",
    "message_format": "tekton_federated",
    
    # Auth if needed
    "headers": {
        "X-Tekton-Stack": "west-coast",
        "Authorization": "Bearer shared-secret"
    },
    
    # Capabilities advertisement
    "capabilities": {
        "version": "1.0",
        "ci_count": 17,
        "specialties": ["nlp", "vision", "robotics"]
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Hermes MCP Extension
- Add registration endpoints to Hermes
- Store in persistent registry
- Implement heartbeat/health checks
- Auto-deregister on timeout

#### 1.3 Local CI Registration
```python
# On CI startup
def register_with_hermes():
    """Each CI calls this on startup"""
    registry_data = {
        "name": self.name,
        "type": self.ci_type,
        "port": self.port,
        "message_endpoint": self.get_message_endpoint(),
        "message_format": self.get_message_format()
    }
    hermes.register(registry_data)
```

## Phase 2: Federated Communication

### Goals
- Extend unified sender to handle federated sends
- Route messages across Tekton stacks
- Enable resource discovery and sharing

### Implementation

#### 2.1 Registry Extension
```python
# New CI types in registry
{
    "name": "tekton-europe",
    "type": "external",  # or "tekton" for full stacks
    "host": "tekton-eu.company.com",
    "federation": {
        "mode": "full",  # full, partial, read-only
        "shared_cis": ["athena-eu", "numa-eu"],
        "access_level": "public"
    }
}
```

#### 2.2 Unified Sender Updates
```python
def send_to_ci(ci_name: str, message: str):
    ci = registry.get_by_name(ci_name)
    
    if ci['type'] in ['tekton', 'external']:
        # Federated send - might need to route through their gateway
        return send_federated_message(ci, message)
    else:
        # Local send
        return send_local_message(ci, message)
```

#### 2.3 MCP Resource Federation
- Discover available resources across stacks
- Federated tool execution
- Cross-stack prompt sharing

## Phase 3: Advanced Federation (Future)

### Potential Features
- Automatic load balancing across stacks
- Federated specialist teams
- Cross-stack workflow orchestration
- Global CI discovery service
- Privacy-preserving federation

## Benefits
1. **Scale** - Distribute work across multiple Tekton installations
2. **Resilience** - Fallback to other stacks if one is down
3. **Specialization** - Different stacks can focus on different domains
4. **Collaboration** - Organizations can share CI capabilities
5. **Testing** - Easy to spin up test Tekton stacks

## Security Considerations
- Mutual TLS for stack-to-stack communication
- API key or OAuth for authentication
- Capability-based access control
- Audit logging for federated requests

## Success Metrics
- Number of federated stacks
- Cross-stack message latency
- Resource sharing utilization
- Federation uptime

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2 weeks (CI Registration)
- Phase 2: 2 weeks (Federated Communication)
- Phase 3: Future sprints as needed
