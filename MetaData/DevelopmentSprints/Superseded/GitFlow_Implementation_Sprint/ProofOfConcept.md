# Proof of Concept: First External Project

## Project Selection: Tekton Python SDK

We'll use a Python SDK for Tekton as our first external project because:
1. Clear scope and requirements
2. Directly benefits Tekton ecosystem
3. Tests multi-language support
4. Validates external repo workflow

## Project Setup

### 1. Repository Creation
```bash
# Casey creates repository
GitHub: github.com/casey/tekton-python-sdk

# Local directory structure
/Users/casey/projects/external/
└── tekton-python-sdk/
    ├── .github/
    │   └── workflows/
    ├── src/
    │   └── tekton_sdk/
    ├── tests/
    ├── docs/
    ├── setup.py
    └── README.md
```

### 2. Project Registration
```bash
# Register with tekton-core
curl -X POST http://localhost:8016/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Tekton Python SDK",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/casey/tekton-python-sdk",
    "directory": "/Users/casey/projects/external/tekton-python-sdk",
    "shepherd": "numa",
    "team": ["apollo", "athena", "synthesis", "sophia"],
    "description": "Official Python SDK for Tekton API"
  }'
```

### 3. Initial Context Building
```bash
# Numa builds project context
aish numa "Initialize tekton-python-sdk project context"

# Numa's tasks:
1. Analyze Tekton's API surface
2. Design SDK architecture
3. Create onboarding guide
4. Establish coding standards
```

## Test Scenario: Complete Feature Implementation

### Issue Creation
```markdown
Issue #1: Implement Basic Client Authentication

Description:
Create a TektonClient class that handles authentication with Tekton services.

Requirements:
- Support API key authentication
- Support OAuth2 flow
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure credential storage

Labels: [enhancement, security, priority-high]
```

### Expected Workflow

#### Day 1: Issue Assignment
```bash
# tekton-core analyzes issue
POST /api/v1/github/issues/analyze
{
  "project_id": "python-sdk",
  "issue_id": 1
}

# Response
{
  "complexity": "medium",
  "suggested_team": ["apollo", "athena"],
  "estimated_hours": 8,
  "security_review_required": true
}

# tekton-core assigns to Apollo (alice terminal)
POST /api/v1/assignments/create
{
  "issue_id": 1,
  "project_id": "python-sdk",
  "terminal": "alice",
  "ai": "apollo"
}
```

#### Day 1: Branch Creation
```bash
# Automatic branch creation
tekton-core creates: feature/alice-1-basic-auth

# Notification to Alice
aish terma alice "Assigned issue #1: Basic Client Auth. Branch created."

# Alice acknowledges
aish terma tekton-core "Starting work on issue #1"
```

#### Day 1-2: Development
```bash
# Apollo (alice) develops
aish apollo "Design TektonClient authentication architecture"
aish apollo "Implement API key authentication"

# Progress reports
Evening Day 1:
aish tekton-core daily-report "Completed API key auth, 40% done"

Morning Day 2:
aish apollo "Implement OAuth2 flow"
aish terma athena "Need security review for credential storage"

# Athena (bob) joins
aish terma alice "I'll review your credential approach"
aish athena "Review secure storage patterns"
```

#### Day 2: Testing
```bash
# Synthesis (charlie) handles testing
aish terma broadcast "Auth implementation ready for testing"
aish synthesis "Write comprehensive auth tests"
aish synthesis "Run security test suite"

# Test results
aish tekton-core test-results "All tests passing for branch feature/alice-1-basic-auth"
```

#### Day 3: PR Creation
```bash
# Apollo requests PR
aish tekton-core create-pr "Issue #1 complete, ready for review"

# tekton-core creates PR
POST /api/v1/github/pr/create
{
  "project_id": "python-sdk",
  "branch": "feature/alice-1-basic-auth",
  "issue_id": 1,
  "title": "feat: Implement basic client authentication",
  "body": "## Summary\n- Added TektonClient class\n- Implemented API key auth\n- Added OAuth2 support\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests: 15 added\n- Security tests: passing\n\nCloses #1"
}
```

#### Day 3: Review Process
```bash
# tekton-core assigns reviewers
- Human: Casey (final approval)
- AI: Numa (shepherd review)
- AI: Athena (security review)

# Review comments
aish numa "Code structure follows SDK patterns. Approved."
aish athena "Security implementation solid. One suggestion for token storage."

# Apollo addresses feedback
aish apollo "Updated token storage per Athena's suggestion"

# Casey's review
Casey: "Looks good. Merge it."
```

#### Day 3: Merge
```bash
# tekton-core merges PR
- Squash and merge
- Delete branch
- Close issue
- Update project metrics
```

## Success Metrics for PoC

1. Create repository
2. Initialize with basic structure
3. Register with tekton-core
4. Assign Numa as shepherd

### Week 2: First Issue

2. Run through complete workflow
3. Document pain points
4. Optimize based on learnings

### Week 3: Parallel Development
1. Create 3-5 issues
2. Assign to different AI teams
3. Test parallel branch development
4. Validate conflict resolution

### Week 4: Full Operations
1. Run daily standup pattern
2. Complete weekly retrospective
3. Generate metrics report

## Configuration for External Project

```yaml
# Project-specific configuration
project:
  id: python-sdk
  type: library
  language: python
  
standards:
  style: pep8
  testing: pytest
  docs: sphinx
  
ci_cd:
  provider: github-actions
  python_versions: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
  
review_requirements:
  ai_reviews: 2
  human_approval: required
  security_review: true  # For auth-related changes
  
ai_team:
  shepherd: numa
  core_team:
    - apollo    # Architecture and implementation
    - athena    # Documentation and knowledge
    - synthesis # Testing and integration
  specialists:
    - sophia    # For ML-related features
    - penia     # For cost optimization
```

## Expected Challenges

### 1. Context Isolation
- **Challenge**: AIs need Tekton context + SDK context
- **Solution**: Numa maintains bridging context

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Challenge**: SDK depends on Tekton API changes
- **Solution**: Version pinning + compatibility matrix

### 3. Testing Across Projects
- **Challenge**: SDK tests need running Tekton instance
- **Solution**: Mock services + integration test environment

## Learning Objectives

1. **Validate multi-project workflow**
2. **Test AI context switching**
3. **Prove external repo isolation**
4. **Measure orchestration overhead**
5. **Identify optimization opportunities**

## Next Projects After Success

1. **Tekton JavaScript SDK** - Test another language
2. **Tekton CLI Tool** - Test end-user application
3. **Documentation Site** - Test non-code project
4. **Example Projects** - Test tutorial management
