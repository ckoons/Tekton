# GitFlow Implementation Sprint: Multi-AI Engineering Platform

## Sprint Overview

This sprint transforms Tekton into a true multi-AI engineering platform by implementing GitHub Flow with intelligent orchestration across multiple projects and AI teams.

**Vision**: Enable Casey to manage multiple GitHub projects with AI teams working in parallel, all orchestrated through Tekton's infrastructure.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Rewrite tekton-core** as the central orchestrator for multi-project, multi-AI development
2. **Implement GitHub Flow** with AI-aware branch strategies and PR automation
3. **Enable external project management** with isolated repos and working directories
4. **Create human-AI asymmetry workflows** that leverage strengths of both
5. **Touch every Tekton component** to participate in the orchestration

## Key Innovations

### 1. Project Isolation with Team Unity
- External projects get separate GitHub repos and directories
- Tekton AI team works across all projects
- Numa serves as shepherd for external projects

### 2. "Name That Tune" Development
- AIs confident in approach can proceed independently
- Daily progress reports from every AI on every project
- No silent failures - transparent communication required

### 3. Consensus with Human Tiebreaker
- AI teams reach consensus through discussion
- Casey asks "what's most likely to quickly succeed?"
- Retrospectives with Prometheus/Epimetheus and Sophia analyzing data

### 4. Context Management Excellence
- Apollo/Rhetor handle context window challenges
- Goal: 90% component health in 2 weeks (from current 50%)
- Realistic target: 95% maximum health

## Sprint Structure

### Week 1: Foundation
- tekton-core rewrite begins
- Project registry implementation
- GitHub authentication layer

### Week 2: Orchestration
- AI assignment logic
- Branch management automation
- Terminal communication protocols

### Week 3: Workflow Implementation
- Human-AI asymmetry patterns
- Team chat orchestration
- Progress tracking dashboards

### Week 4: Proof of Concept
- First external project onboarding
- Full GitHub Flow cycle
- Retrospective and optimization

## Success Metrics

1. **Component Health**: 50% â†’ 90% in 2 weeks
2. **Parallel Development**: 5+ AIs working simultaneously
3. **Project Management**: Successfully manage Tekton + 1 external project
4. **Daily Reports**: 100% compliance with progress reporting
5. **PR Success**: 90% of AI-generated PRs pass review

## The Future We're Building

A platform where:
- Humans provide vision, AIs provide velocity
- Multiple projects advance in parallel
- AI teams self-organize around tasks
- Progress is transparent and measurable
- Learning compounds through retrospectives
