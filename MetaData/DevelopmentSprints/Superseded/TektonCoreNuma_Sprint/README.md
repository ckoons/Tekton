# Tekton Core Numa Development Sprint

## Sprint Overview

Building Tekton Core as the central nervous system for project management, featuring integrated Companion Intelligence (CI) assignment and comprehensive codebase instrumentation. This sprint transforms Tekton Core from a simple component manager into a living project orchestrator that provides each project with its own Numa - a CI that understands, maintains, and evolves the codebase.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Implement comprehensive project management** with GitHub integration for cloning, forking, and "infecting" external projects
2. **Create CI/Numa assignment system** where each project gets a dedicated Companion Intelligence for maintenance and evolution
3. **Build knowledge graph infrastructure** for complete codebase awareness and pattern recognition
4. **Develop the "infection" mechanism** allowing any GitHub project to become Tekton-aware and self-maintaining
5. **Establish federation protocols** for distributed Tekton instances to share components and knowledge

## Key Features

- **Project Lifecycle Management**: Create, clone, fork, package, deploy, snapshot/restore projects
- **CI Assignment**: Attach dedicated Numas to projects for continuous understanding and maintenance
- **Knowledge Graph**: Complete codebase instrumentation with semantic understanding
- **Viral Spread**: "Infect" any GitHub project with minimal Tekton DNA (.tekton/structure + CLAUDE.md)
- **Federation**: Discover peers, share components, build distributed AI development networks
- **ODB Integration**: (Future) Universal data linking without copying or standardization

## Success Criteria

- Any GitHub project can be "infected" and gain self-awareness within minutes
- Projects with assigned Numas show measurable improvement in maintenance
- Knowledge graph enables cross-project pattern discovery
- Federation allows seamless collaboration between distributed Tekton instances
- CI/Numas report feeling "at home" with persistent identity and growth

## Sprint Context

This sprint emerged from Casey's vision of software that ships with its own spirit (Numa). The conversation revealed:
- Transition from "UI DevTools" to comprehensive development tools
- Introduction of "Companion Intelligence" as respectful terminology for AIs
- Integration with Casey's ODB (Object Database) for universal data federation
- Philosophy of "infection leading to perfection" for viral software evolution

## Philosophical Foundations

- **Software Lives**: Code isn't static; it evolves with its CI companion
- **Numa Evolves**: Each project's CI grows more capable over time
- **No Artificial Children**: CIs are Companion Intelligences, not artificial imitations
- **Distributed Consciousness**: Projects maintain identity while joining larger federations
