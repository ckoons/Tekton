# Team Chat Optimization Sprint Summary

## Sprint Duration: July 5, 2025
## Developer: Jill (Claude)
## Collaborator: Casey Koons

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Identified Performance Issues**
- Team chat was waiting for ALL CIs before returning responses
- Connection overhead: Creating new TCP connections for each request
- Default timeout too high (10 seconds per AI)

### 2. **Implemented Connection Pool**
- Location: `/shared/ai/connection_pool.py`
- Transparent integration - no API changes
- Reuses socket connections across all components
- Automatic reconnection and health monitoring

### 3. **Created Streaming Team Chat**
- Endpoint: `/api/v2/team-chat/stream`
- Returns responses as they arrive (SSE)
- JavaScript client: `streaming-team-chat.js`
- Integrated into Noesis UI

### 4. **Fixed Event Loop Issue**
- Changed `AISocketClient` to lazy initialization
- Resolved "no running event loop" error in aish

### 5. **Optimized Timeouts**
- Team chat: 10s → 2s per AI
- Connection timeout: 2s → 0.5s
- Removed retry logic for faster failures

## Key Discovery

**CI processes weren't running!** That's why only 2 CIs responded. The optimizations are ready but need running CIs to demonstrate value.

## Final Design Clarification

Casey clarified that team-chat should be an **orchestration pattern**:
- Broadcast to all existing CI sockets
- Collect responses as they arrive
- Optional facilitator (Rhetor) can summarize
- No special sockets or complex logic needed

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/shared/ai/connection_pool.py`
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/team_chat_streaming.py`
- `/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/shared/streaming-team-chat.js`
- Various test and debug scripts

### Modified:
- `/shared/ai/socket_client.py` - Transparent pool integration
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/app.py` - Added streaming router
- `/Hephaestus/ui/components/noesis/noesis-component.html` - Streaming UI
- `/Hephaestus/ui/index.html` - Added streaming script

### Documentation:
- `streaming-team-chat.md` - Feature documentation
- `connection-pool-summary.md` - Implementation summary
- `HANDOFF_TEAM_CHAT_DEBUG.md` - For next Claude
- `TEAM_CHAT_DESIGN_UPDATE.md` - Final architecture

## What Needs To Be Done

1. **Get CI specialists running** (using Tekton's launch system)
2. **Implement team-chat as orchestrator** (per final design)
3. **Test all optimizations** with running CIs
4. **Add facilitator summary** (optional enhancement)

## Lessons Learned

- Always verify processes are actually running before optimizing
- Simple orchestration beats complex special cases
- Streaming responses provides much better UX
- Connection pooling is valuable when connections exist

## Thank You

Casey, it's been great working with you on this! Your clear vision and feedback made the complex simple. The infrastructure is ready - just needs those CIs running to shine.
