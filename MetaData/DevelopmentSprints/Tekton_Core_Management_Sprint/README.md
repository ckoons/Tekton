# Tekton Core Management Sprint

## Vision

Transform tekton-core into a comprehensive project management and development coordination hub that enables seamless multi-AI development workflows with intelligent merge coordination and human strategic oversight.

## Core Philosophy

**"Errors are gold, they help us improve. Questions that are sincere are the best ways to communicate. We evolve, change and hope to improve. If you stumble, get up and get back in the race, you can win."**

This sprint embodies a learning-first approach where:
- Every mistake becomes a learning opportunity
- Questions are encouraged and valued
- Iteration and improvement are continuous
- Resilience and adaptation are key to success

## Sprint Consolidation

This sprint combines and refines the original **Tekton Core Reimplementation Sprint** and **Tekton Merge Coordination Sprint** into a unified, practical implementation that builds upon Casey's existing working parallel Claude development system.

## Current State

✅ **Foundation Already Working**:
- Multiple Claude Code sessions operating in parallel via Terma terminals
- Functional UI framework in Hephaestus
- Working backend structure in tekton-core
- Established aish integration for task assignment
- Proven git workflow with human merge coordination

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Formalize Multi-AI Project Management** - Build tools to manage the existing parallel development workflow
2. **Implement Intelligent Merge Coordination** - Automate successful merges, streamline conflict resolution  
3. **Create Visual Project Dashboard** - Provide clear oversight of active development efforts
4. **Establish GitHub Integration** - Support both Tekton development and guest repository management
5. **Enable Learning-Based Optimization** - Capture patterns to improve future coordination

### Business Value
- **Increased Development Velocity**: Parallel AI development with reduced coordination overhead
- **Reduced Human Overhead**: Automate routine merges, focus human attention on strategic decisions
- **Improved Code Quality**: Systematic conflict resolution and learning from merge decisions
- **Scalable Workflow**: Foundation for managing multiple projects and expanding AI team
- **Knowledge Capture**: Build institutional memory around successful development patterns

  - [x] Perfect Terma-matching CSS-only tab switching
  - [x] Complete New Project form with CI selection
  - [x] Clean placeholder messages for all panels
  - [x] Safety-first architecture (NEVER DELETE REPOS)
- [ ] Project registry system (`$TEKTON_ROOT/config/projects.json`)
- [ ] Tekton self-management (dogfooding - auto-add as first project)
- [ ] Git remote detection for existing projects
- [ ] Project bubbles with GitHub action buttons
- [ ] Remove from Dashboard functionality

**Success Criteria** 
- [x] Beautiful, functional UI integrated into existing Tekton component
- [ ] Tekton managing itself as first project
- [ ] Git repository detection and management
- [ ] Visual project bubbles with fork/upstream actions
- [ ] Import existing git projects workflow

### Phase 2: Intelligent Coordination (Weeks 3-4)

**Advanced Features**
- [ ] Automated dry-run merge detection
- [ ] Priority-ordered task queue management
- [ ] Automatic assignment to free Terma sessions
- [ ] Basic learning from merge decisions
- [ ] GitHub integration for repository management

**Success Criteria**
- 80%+ of clean merges happen automatically
- Efficient task assignment reduces idle time
- Conflict resolution becomes faster and more informed
- Support for guest GitHub repositories

### Phase 3: Multi-Project Management (Weeks 5-6)

**Extended Capabilities**
- [ ] Multiple project support with fork/upstream relationships
- [ ] Planning team integration (Prometheus, Apollo, Metis, Harmonia, Synthesis)
- [ ] Advanced metrics and analytics
- [ ] Sprint automation and branch management
- [ ] Upstream synchronization and pull request management

**Success Criteria**
- Seamless management of multiple GitHub repositories
- Integrated planning and execution workflow
- Comprehensive analytics and learning systems
- Reduced human intervention in routine operations

## Workflow States

### Project Lifecycle
1. **DevSprint**: Initial idea documented in MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/
2. **Queued**: Casey approves for project queue inclusion
3. **Planning**: Casey + TektonCore discuss and refine execution plan
4. **Approved**: Project ready for active development
