# Tekton Merge Coordination Sprint

## Sprint Overview

**Objective**: Implement an AI-powered merge coordination system that enables multiple AI workers to collaborate on code development with intelligent conflict resolution and minimal human intervention.

**Vision**: Create the world's first AI-native development workflow where:
- Multiple Claude instances work independently on separate branches
- Tekton-core acts as intelligent merge coordinator
- AI consensus resolves most conflicts automatically
- Humans only make simple A/B decisions when needed
- Workers learn from merge decisions to improve over time

## Key Innovation

This system transforms the traditional git workflow into an AI-orchestrated development process:

```
Traditional: Developer → Git → Manual Merge → Main
AI-Native:   AI Workers → Git → AI Coordinator → AI Consensus → (Human A/B) → Main
```

## Sprint Goals

1. **Implement Merge Coordinator in tekton-core**
   - Monitor worker branches for merge readiness
   - Attempt automatic merges
   - Orchestrate AI consensus for conflicts
   - Escalate to human when needed

2. **Create aish Integration**
   - `aish merge-coordinator` commands
   - Worker notification system
   - Team-chat integration for consensus

3. **Build Human Decision Interface**
   - Simple A/B choice presentation
   - Clear AI analysis and recommendations
   - One-command resolution

4. **Implement Learning System**
   - Refactor tasks for non-selected code
   - Engram integration for pattern learning
   - Improvement metrics

## Architecture Components

### 1. Merge Coordinator (tekton-core)
- Runs as background service
- Monitors all `sprint/worker_*` branches
- Manages merge queue and conflict resolution
- Tracks merge history and patterns

### 2. AI Consensus System
- Uses team-chat for conflict discussion
- Synthesis AI creates unified solutions
- Confidence scoring for auto-merge decisions
- Round limits to prevent endless debate

### 3. Human Escalation Interface
- Clean A/B comparisons with AI analysis
- Pros/cons for each option
- AI voting results and reasoning
- Single keystroke decisions

### 4. Worker Feedback Loop
- Refactor tasks for learning
- Pattern recognition in Engram
- Continuous improvement metrics

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - [ ] Multiple AI workers can develop simultaneously
   - [ ] Clean merges happen automatically
   - [ ] Conflicts trigger AI consensus rounds
   - [ ] Human escalation works smoothly
   - [ ] Workers receive learning feedback

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - [ ] 80%+ conflicts resolved by AI consensus
   - [ ] <2 minute average merge time
   - [ ] <5 minute human decision time
   - [ ] Zero lost code or corrupted merges

3. **Learning Metrics**
   - [ ] Decreasing human escalations over time
   - [ ] Improving AI consensus confidence
   - [ ] Workers adapting to merge feedback

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

- [ ] Conflict detection and parsing

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Team-chat consensus protocol
- [ ] Synthesis AI integration
- [ ] Confidence scoring system
- [ ] Round-based discussion limits

### Phase 3: Human Interface (Week 3)
- [ ] A/B decision interface
- [ ] AI analysis presentation
- [ ] Decision application system
- [ ] Refactor task creation

### Phase 4: Learning System (Week 4)
- [ ] Engram pattern storage
- [ ] Worker feedback delivery
- [ ] Metrics and reporting
- [ ] Continuous improvement tracking

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backup Strategy**: Keep separate `main-backup` branch
2. **Rollback Plan**: All merges tagged for easy reversion
3. **Manual Override**: Always allow human full control
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all decisions

## Questions for Casey

1. **Worker Identification**: How should we identify/authenticate different Claude workers?
2. **Merge Frequency**: How often should the coordinator check for ready merges?
3. **Conflict Threshold**: How many AI discussion rounds before human escalation?
4. **Branch Naming**: Stick with `sprint/worker_*` pattern or something else?
5. **Human Interface**: Terminal-based A/B choice or web interface?
6. **Learning Priorities**: What patterns are most important to capture?
7. **Deployment**: Run coordinator on same machine or separate service?

## Why This is a Game Changer

1. **Parallel AI Development**: Multiple Claudes working simultaneously without coordination overhead
2. **Intelligent Merging**: AI understanding of code intent, not just syntax
3. **Continuous Learning**: Every merge makes the system smarter
4. **Human Amplification**: Humans make strategic decisions, AIs handle implementation
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of development decisions and rationale
6. **Scalability**: Add more AI workers without increasing complexity

This could fundamentally change how software is developed - from single-threaded human development to massively parallel AI development with intelligent coordination.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine this sprint plan
2. Set up test environment with multiple Tekton clones
3. Implement Phase 1 core infrastructure
4. Test with simple merge scenarios
5. Iterate based on results
