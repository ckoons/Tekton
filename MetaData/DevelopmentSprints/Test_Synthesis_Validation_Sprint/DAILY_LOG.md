# Test Synthesis Validation Sprint - Daily Log

**Sprint Name**: Test Synthesis Validation
**Status**: Ready-3:Synthesis
**Start Date**: 2025-01-30
**End Date**: TBD
**Sprint Lead**: Synthesis UI Testing Team

## Sprint Overview
This is a test sprint created to validate the Synthesis UI implementation. This sprint simulates a workflow that has passed through Telos → Prometheus → Metis → Harmonia and is now ready for validation testing in Synthesis.

## Current Status: Ready-3:Synthesis
The sprint has completed workflow orchestration in Harmonia and requires validation testing before proceeding to Planning Review.

## Workflow Summary
**Total Tasks**: 8
**Total Hours**: 32
**Components Involved**: Hermes, Engram, Athena, Synthesis

### Task Breakdown (from Metis):
1. **Initialize Test Environment** (4h)
   - Set up test database connections
   - Configure API endpoints
   - Initialize mock data

2. **Implement Core Validation Logic** (6h)
   - Create validation rules engine
   - Implement dry-run capability
   - Add checkpoint system

3. **Build Integration Tests** (5h)
   - Test Hermes API connectivity
   - Validate Engram memory access
   - Check Athena knowledge graph queries

4. **Create UI Components** (4h)
   - Design validation interface
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Add result visualization

5. **Implement Rollback System** (3h)
   - Create state snapshots
   - Build rollback mechanism
   - Test recovery procedures

6. **Performance Testing** (4h)
   - Load testing scenarios
   - Response time validation
   - Resource usage monitoring

7. **Documentation** (3h)
   - API documentation
   - User guide creation
   - Integration examples

8. **Final Review Preparation** (3h)
   - Compile validation reports
   - Create coverage analysis
   - Prepare handoff documentation

## Validation Requirements
- All tasks must pass dry-run testing
- Integration points must respond within 100ms
- Code coverage must exceed 80%
- All documentation must be complete
- No critical security vulnerabilities

## Integration Points to Test
1. **Hermes API** - Service registration and discovery
2. **Engram Memory** - Context storage and retrieval
3. **Athena Knowledge Graph** - Query performance
4. **External Database** - Connection pooling and timeouts
5. **Message Queue** - Event propagation
6. **File System** - Read/write permissions

## Expected Outcomes
Upon successful validation:
- Sprint status updates to "Ready-Review"
- Validation report generated
- Coverage analysis completed
- Ready for Planning Team review

## Notes
This is a test sprint for UI validation. The tasks and requirements are simulated but follow the actual workflow pattern expected in production sprints.
