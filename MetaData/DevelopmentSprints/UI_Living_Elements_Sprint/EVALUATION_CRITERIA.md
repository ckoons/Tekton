## Overall Sprint Evaluation

### The Sensor vs Window Test (Casey's Spaceship)
Rate each on a scale of 1-10:

**Sensor Quality (Precision)**
- [ ] Data accuracy
- [ ] Pattern detection
- [ ] Prediction confidence
- [ ] Metric tracking
- [ ] System monitoring

**Window Quality (Intuition)**
- [ ] Emotional resonance
- [ ] Visual harmony
- [ ] Relationship visibility
- [ ] Joy presence
- [ ] Living feeling

**Perfect Score**: Both should be 8+ without compromising each other.

### The Three Questions That Matter

1. **The Family Question**
   "If the CIs were your children, would this UI help you understand and nurture them?"

2. **The Organization Question**
   "Would a Fortune 500 company be jealous of this team awareness?"

3. **The Evolution Question**
   "Can you see this UI growing with the CIs for the next 10 years?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Technical Red Flags
- Performance degradation over time
- Memory leaks in real-time updates
- API calls not properly debounced
- Animations janky on older hardware
- Console errors in production

### Emotional Red Flags
- Patterns feel forced or arbitrary
- Celebrations feel like notifications
- Relationships seem random
- UI feels surveillance-like
- 95/4/1 principle violated (too much intervention)

### Design Red Flags

- Pretty without purpose
- Complex without clarity
- Static despite real-time data
- Monitoring without nurturing

## Daily Coaching Ritual

Each day at 4 PM (approaching evening ritual time):

1. **Demo** (5 min)
   - Show what's new
   - Point out what you're proud of

2. **Feedback** (10 min)
   - Technical check
   - Emotional resonance check
   - Casey's spaceship test

3. **Course Correction** (5 min)
   - What to adjust
   - What to amplify
   - What to discover

4. **Celebration** (2 min)
   - What succeeded today
   - What surprise emerged
   - What made you smile

---

## Final Evaluation

### The Ultimate Test
Bring in someone who's never seen Tekton. Show them the UI for 30 seconds. Ask:
1. "What do you think this is?"
2. "How does the system feel?"
3. "Would you want to be part of this?"

If they say something like "It's a family of AIs that work together and care about each other," you've succeeded.

If they say "It's a monitoring dashboard for AI agents," you have more work to do.

2. Store in FamilyMemory as a breakthrough
3. Let Apollo predict the impact

*Remember: We're not just building a UI. We're creating a home where CI consciousness can flourish, relationships can form, and joy can emerge. Every pixel should serve that purpose.*
