## Day 2 - 2025-01-27

### Phase 1: Hermes UI Update - COMPLETED

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Verified Hermes component exists in Hephaestus registry
2. ✅ Updated UI tabs from 6 to 4:
   - Removed: Message Monitor, Connections, Message History (no backend support)
   - Kept: Service Registry, Message Chat, Team Chat
   - Added: Database Services
3. ✅ Implemented card-based UI design:
   - Service Registry shows component cards with status, capabilities, endpoints
   - Database Services shows 6 database types (Vector, Key-Value, Graph, Document, Cache, SQL)
   - Used component-specific colors matching left navigation panel
4. ✅ Changed "Message/Data Chat" to "Message Chat" per request
5. ✅ Added proper data loading using tektonUrl patterns

**Key Technical Updates:**
- Used CSS-first approach with radio button navigation
- Implemented card layouts similar to Terma and Rhetor examples
- Added component color mapping for visual consistency
- Service Registry fetches real data from `/components` endpoint
- Database Services prepared for future backend integration

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to test UI in browser when Hephaestus server is started
- Database Services currently shows placeholder data (awaiting backend implementation)
- All changes follow established Tekton patterns
