# UI Update Sprint - Handoff Document

## Current Status
**Phase**: Planning Complete
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 - Hermes Validation

## Sprint Overview
This sprint covers validation and updates for all Tekton components not included in the Planning Team Workflow sprint. It runs in parallel and ensures every component is functional and ready for integration.

## Phase Breakdown

### Communication & Organization
- **Phase 1**: Hermes (mail/messaging)
- **Phase 7**: Penia (resource management)
- **Phase 8**: Ergon (workflow automation)

### CI Intelligence Tools
- **Phase 2**: Engram (semantic memory)
- **Phase 3**: Rhetor (documentation)
- **Phase 4**: Apollo (code quality)
- **Phase 5**: Integration of above three

### Research & Analysis
- **Phase 6**: Noesis & Sophia (research twins)
- **Phase 10**: Terma & Numa (terminal & math)

## Key Context for Next Session

### Starting Points
1. Check Hephaestus component registry for all components
2. Verify which components already have UI implementations
3. Start with Hermes as it's likely most complete

### Important Notes
- Phase 9 was intentionally skipped (Casey numbered 1-8, then 10)
- Focus on validation over new features
- Document all issues found for follow-on sprints
- This sprint prepares for YouTube demonstrations

### Integration Focus (Phase 5)
Special attention to Phase 5 which integrates:
- Engram as shared memory for CIs
- Rhetor for CI documentation
- Apollo for code pattern storage

This creates a collaborative CI environment where components can:
- Share learned patterns
- Document their operations
- Maintain quality standards

## Parallel Execution
While Planning Team Workflow sprint handles:
- Telos, Prometheus, Metis, Harmonia, Synthesis, TektonCore

This sprint handles:
- All other components ensuring complete coverage

## Success Metrics
- Every component loads and displays
- Core functionality verified
- Integration points tested
- UI consistency achieved
- Ready for full integration sprint

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Navigate to Hephaestus
2. Check each component in registry
3. Start Hermes validation
4. Document findings in DAILY_LOG.md
5. Update task completion in SPRINT_PLAN.md

## Questions to Resolve
- Current state of each component UI
- Which backends are currently running
- Any missing component implementations
- Priority order within phases
