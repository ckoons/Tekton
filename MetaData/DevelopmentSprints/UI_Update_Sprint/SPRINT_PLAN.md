## Technical Decisions
- Maintain CSS-first approach across all components
- Use existing Tekton patterns for consistency
- Focus on functionality validation over new features
- Document any issues for follow-on sprint

## Out of Scope
- Major feature additions
- Backend rewrites
- External service integrations
- Performance optimization (unless critical)

## Success Metrics
- All components load without errors
- Each component performs its core function
- Integration points validated
- UI consistency achieved
- Ready for integration sprint

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Unknown component states
  - **Mitigation**: Start with basic validation, document issues
- **Risk**: Integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 5 dedicated to integration
- **Risk**: Time constraints
  - **Mitigation**: Parallel execution, focus on core functionality

## Notes
- This sprint runs parallel to Planning Team Workflow sprint
- Focus is on validation and readiness, not perfection
- Document all issues for follow-on sprints
- Prepare components for YouTube demonstration
