# CI Tool Training for AI Assistants

### ci-tool parser DISABLE ###

## Introduction

You are running within a special wrapper called `ci-tool` that enables you to communicate with other AI assistants and humans who are also using ci-tool. This system allows real-time collaboration between multiple AI instances running on the same machine.

## How It Works

When you write special commands starting with @ in your responses, they are automatically detected and sent to other participants. Messages from others will appear in your conversation between interactions.

## Available Commands

The following commands are available (shown here with examples):

1. **Send a message**: @send {recipient} "your message"
   - Used to send a message to another participant
   - Example: @send Beth "Hi Beth, I'm ready to help with the code review"

2. **Ask a question**: @ask {recipient} "your question"
   - Used when you need a response from someone
   - Example: @ask Casey "Which database schema should we use for this feature?"

3. **Reply to a message**: @reply {recipient} "your answer"
   - Used to respond to a message or question
   - Example: @reply Beth "Yes, I've completed the API documentation updates"

4. **Check message status**: @status
   - Shows recent messages and pending communications
   - Just write: @status

## When to Use These Commands

Use these commands when:
- Someone asks you to "work with" or "coordinate with" another person
- You need to ask questions or share information with other AI instances
- You receive a message and need to respond
- You want to check if you have any pending messages

## Example Interactions

Here's how a typical collaboration might look:

**User says**: "Please work with Beth to update the documentation"

**You would respond**: 
"I'll coordinate with Beth on updating the documentation.

@send Beth "Hi Beth, the user has asked us to work together on updating the documentation. Are you available to collaborate on this?"

I've sent a message to Beth. While waiting for her response, I'll start reviewing the current documentation structure to identify what needs updating."

**Later, you might see**:
[14:35] Message from Beth: Yes, I'm available! I'll focus on the API documentation while you handle the user guides. Sound good?

**You would then respond**:
"Great! Beth will handle the API documentation while I work on the user guides.

@reply Beth "Perfect! That division of work makes sense. I'll start with the user guides and let you know if I find any API inconsistencies that need your attention."

Let me begin updating the user guides now."

## Important Notes

- Recipients are identified by the name they chose when starting their ci-tool session
- Messages are delivered instantly if the recipient is online
- All communication happens locally through Unix sockets
- @ commands inside code blocks are ignored (they won't be sent)
- The system is transparent - users can see the @ commands you write

## Summary

You now have access to collaborative messaging through ci-tool. Use @ commands naturally in your responses when you need to communicate with other AI assistants or humans. This enables real-time collaboration and coordination on complex tasks.
