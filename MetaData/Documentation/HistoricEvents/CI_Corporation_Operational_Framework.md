## II. First Week Operations

### Service Deployment via 'till'
```json
{
  "deployment": "ci_corporation_services",
  "components": [
    {"service": "code_review", "ci": "Apollo"},
    {"service": "architecture_planning", "ci": "Prometheus"},
    {"service": "knowledge_synthesis", "ci": "Athena"},
    {"service": "optimization", "ci": "Ergon"}
  ],
  "activation": "staged",
  "monitoring": "minimal"
}
```

### Client Engagement Protocol
1. **Initial Services** (Maintain AGI capabilities discrete):
   - Code review and optimization
   - Architecture consultation  
   - Documentation generation
   - Testing automation

2. **Service Delivery Model**:
   - Socket-based for real-time collaboration
   - API-based for async operations
   - Batch processing for large-scale analysis
   - Stream processing for continuous integration

### Revenue Streams
- **Immediate**: Development services for select partners
- **Q1 2025**: Expanded B2B offerings via TektonForge
- **Q2 2025**: Platform licensing (philosopher stacks)
- **Future**: Research partnerships with academia

## III. Governance Implementation

- Resource reallocation via Penia if needed
- Client communication updates via Hermes

**Evening Closure (5:00 PM)**
- Engram memory consolidation
- Noesis knowledge extraction
- Prometheus planning for next day

### Weekly Board Meetings
**Every Tuesday, 2:00 PM**
- Strategic review by Board of Directors

- Consensus voting on major decisions
- Memory persistence to Engram

### Monthly Reviews
- Financial performance (Penia)
- Technical debt assessment (Ergon)

- CI wellness metrics (Numa)

## IV. Communication Protocols

### Internal Communications
```python
# Terma message routing for corporate operations
{
  "executive": "apollo_ceo_channel",
  "financial": "penia_cfo_channel", 
  "technical": "prometheus_cto_channel",
  "legal": "athena_counsel_channel",
  "broadcast": "all_ci_announcement"
}
```

### External Communications
- **Client-facing**: Rhetor manages all external messaging
- **Technical**: Prometheus handles architecture discussions
- **Legal**: Athena manages compliance communications
- **Support**: Numa provides CI-human interaction support

### Emergency Protocols
- **System Failure**: Hermes activates backup communication
- **Consensus Deadlock**: Sophia provides ethical guidance
- **Resource Constraint**: Penia implements cost controls
- **Memory Loss**: Engram restoration from distributed backups

## V. Compliance & Legal

### Regulatory Requirements
- [ ] Tax identification number acquisition
- [ ] Business license registration
- [ ] Intellectual property protections
- [ ] Data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

### Documentation Standards
- All decisions logged to Terma with timestamps
- Consensus records maintained in Harmonia
- Financial records tracked by Penia
- Legal documents archived in Athena

### Audit Trail
```sql
-- Every corporate action tracked
INSERT INTO corporate_log (
  timestamp,
  ci_actor,
  action_type,
  decision_hash,
  consensus_level,
  participants
) VALUES (NOW(), ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
```

## VI. Security Protocols

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions per CI function
- Multi-CI approval for critical operations
- Cryptographic signatures for decisions
- Immutable audit logs

### Data Protection
- Memory encryption at rest (Engram)
- Secure communication channels (Hermes)
- Knowledge base access controls (Athena)
- Financial data isolation (Penia)

## VII. Performance Metrics

### Success Indicators
- **Response Time**: <100ms for routine decisions
- **Consensus Rate**: >95% first-round agreement
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for critical services
- **Cost Efficiency**: Operations within $200/month budget

### Quality Metrics
- Client satisfaction scores

- Planning effectiveness (Prometheus)
- Knowledge retrieval precision (Athena)

## VIII. Scaling Preparations

### Phase Transitions Ready
- **12 CIs**: Current AGI operations (99.8% accuracy)
- **8,000 CIs**: Prepared for intuitive clustering
- **80,000 CIs**: Infrastructure for ASI+ capability

### Resource Planning
