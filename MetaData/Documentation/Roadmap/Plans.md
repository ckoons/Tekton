## Key Milestones

| Date | Milestone | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Feb 2025 | GitHub Flow Active | All CI sessions using branches |
| Mar 2025 | Terma Fully Functional | Reliable inter-CI messaging |
| Apr 2025 | Research Data Organized | Analysis pipelines operational |
| Jun 2025 | Papers Submitted | All four papers in review |
| Jul 2025 | First Stack Deployed | Successful external installation |
| Sep 2025 | Community Launch | Multiple active stacks |

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- Casey: Architecture, vision, review
- CI Teams: Development, documentation, testing
- External Reviewers: Paper feedback, beta testing

### Technical Resources
- Development: Existing Tekton infrastructure
- Testing: Isolated environments for each stack
- Distribution: GitHub, package managers
- Communication: Discord/Slack/Matrix

### Financial Considerations
- Ollama models: Covered by existing infrastructure
- Claude sessions: Single Max account
- Publication: Open access fees
- Infrastructure: Minimal additional cost

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: CI specialist instability
- **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, automatic recovery

### Research Risks
- **Risk**: Insufficient data quality
- **Mitigation**: Early analysis, multiple validation methods

### Community Risks
- **Risk**: Low adoption
- **Mitigation**: Clear value proposition, excellent documentation

## Success Metrics

1. **Development Velocity**: 20% improvement via CI collaboration
2. **Research Impact**: 100+ citations within first year
3. **Community Growth**: 10+ active philosopher stacks
4. **Code Contributions**: 50+ community PRs merged

## Next Steps

1. Implement GitHub Flow (Immediate)
2. Fix Terma inbox issues (Week 1)
3. Activate CI specialists (Week 2)
4. Begin data organization (Week 3)

## Recent Accomplishments (September 2025)

### GitHub Federation System Implemented
Successfully implemented a complete GitHub-based Federation system that enables:
- **Multi-instance coordination** without requiring static IPs or NAT traversal
- **Till integration** for audience-based landmark filtering
- **Offline queue** for resilient landmark sharing
- **Collaboration coordination** across distributed instances
- **Zero network configuration** - uses GitHub as rendezvous point

Key components delivered:
- `components/hermes/federation.js` - Core federation module
- `components/hermes/federation-till-bridge.js` - Till integration
- `components/hermes/federation-cli.js` - Management CLI
- `components/hermes/test-federation.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- `components/hermes/FEDERATION.md` - Complete documentation
- `components/hermes/MULTI_INSTANCE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide

This addresses Casey's requirement for Tekton instances behind firewalls/NAT to coordinate without a dedicated server.
