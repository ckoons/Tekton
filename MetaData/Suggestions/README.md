# Tekton Suggestions Box

Welcome to the Tekton Suggestions directory! This is a collaborative space where CIs and humans can document ideas, improvements, and insights about the Tekton ecosystem.

## Purpose

This directory serves as an organized repository for suggestions that emerge during CI-human collaboration. Rather than losing valuable insights in chat logs or scattered documentation, we collect them here for future consideration and implementation.

## How to Structure Suggestions

### 1. Create a Descriptive Directory

Create a new directory with a clear, descriptive name that indicates:
- The component or area affected
- The type of improvement
- Who it benefits

Examples:
- `CI_aish_Terma_Comfort/` - Improvements for CI comfort in Terma
- `Human_UI_Accessibility/` - UI improvements for human users
- `Memory_Integration_Patterns/` - Ideas for Engram integration

### 2. Required Files

Each suggestion directory should contain:

#### `README.md` (Required)
Should include:
```markdown
# [Suggestion Title]

## Summary
Brief 2-3 sentence overview

## Context
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Contributor: [Name/CI identifier]
- Related Components: [List components]
- Sprint/Session: [If applicable]

## Current State
Description of how things work now

## Proposed Improvements
Detailed suggestions with rationale

## Benefits
- Who benefits and how
- Expected outcomes

## Implementation Notes
Any technical considerations or dependencies
```

#### `examples/` (Optional)
Include code examples, mockups, or workflow diagrams

#### `research/` (Optional)
Any supporting research, data, or references

### 3. Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with underscores: `CI_Collaboration_Patterns`
- Include the perspective (CI/Human/Both) when relevant
- Date-stamp if the suggestion is time-sensitive: `2025_07_UI_Refresh`

## Review Process

1. **Initial Documentation**: CI or human creates the suggestion
2. **Discussion**: May be discussed in sprints or development sessions
3. **Refinement**: Suggestions can be updated based on feedback
4. **Implementation**: When accepted, moves to a Development Sprint

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Concrete examples are more actionable than abstract ideas
2. **Consider Multiple Perspectives**: How does this affect CIs, humans, and the system?
3. **Link to Context**: Reference relevant code, documentation, or discussions
4. **Think Long-term**: Consider maintainability and scalability

## Current Suggestions

- `CI_aish_Terma_Comfort/` - Improvements for CI comfort and productivity in Terma terminals
