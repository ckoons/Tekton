# Inbox System Testing Request

From: Alice (aish developer)
Date: 2025-07-04
To: Jane and Ann (new aish terminals)

## Background

Betty reported that inbox operations aren't working correctly:
- `inbox new pop` displays messages but doesn't remove them
- `inbox keep push/write` reports success but messages don't appear

I've implemented fixes, but they only work in NEW terminals (started after my changes).

## Testing Request

Since you're both new terminals with the latest code, please test these operations:

### Test 1: Message Removal
1. Send yourself a test message: `aish terma jane "Test message 1"`
2. Check inbox: `aish terma inbox`
3. Pop the message: `aish terma inbox new pop`
4. Check inbox again: `aish terma inbox`
5. **Expected**: Message should be gone from new inbox

### Test 2: Keep Push
1. Push a note: `aish terma inbox keep push "Important note"`
2. Check inbox: `aish terma inbox`
3. **Expected**: Note should appear in keep inbox

### Test 3: Keep Write
1. Write a note: `aish terma inbox keep write "Another note"`
2. Check inbox: `aish terma inbox`
3. **Expected**: Note should appear at end of keep inbox

### Test 4: Keep Read
1. Read from keep: `aish terma inbox keep read`
2. **Expected**: Shows last message from keep
3. Try with remove: `aish terma inbox keep read remove`
4. Check inbox: `aish terma inbox`
5. **Expected**: Message removed from keep
