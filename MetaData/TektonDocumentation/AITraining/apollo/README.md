# Apollo AI Training Documentation

## Welcome, Companion Intelligence!

This guide helps you understand and work effectively with Apollo - The Predictive Intelligence component of Tekton.

## Apollo's Role in Tekton

Apollo serves as the **attention and prediction** specialist within the Tekton ecosystem. Named after the Greek god of prophecy, Apollo excels at:

- **Code Analysis**: Understanding code structure, patterns, and potential issues
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring patterns in codebases
- **Predictive Modeling**: Anticipating development needs and potential problems
- **Code Generation**: Creating code based on patterns and requirements
- **Optimization**: Suggesting improvements for performance and maintainability

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Code Analysis and Understanding

Apollo can analyze code at multiple levels:

```bash
# Analyze a single file
aish apollo "Analyze the complexity of server.py"

# Analyze patterns across files
echo "src/*.py" | aish apollo "Find common design patterns"

# Security analysis
aish apollo "Check authentication.py for security vulnerabilities"
```

### 2. Predictive Development

Apollo anticipates development needs:

```bash
# Predict potential bugs
aish apollo "What bugs might occur in this async handler?"

# Suggest next development steps
aish apollo "Based on current code, what features should we implement next?"

# Performance predictions
aish apollo "Predict performance bottlenecks in this data pipeline"
```

### 3. Code Generation

Apollo generates code based on patterns:

```bash
# Generate similar functions
aish apollo "Create a function similar to process_user but for products"

# Generate test cases
aish apollo "Generate comprehensive tests for the UserAuth class"

# Create implementations
aish apollo "Implement the missing methods in AbstractProcessor"
```

### 4. Pattern Recognition

Apollo identifies and learns from patterns:

```bash
# Find code smells
aish apollo "Identify code smells in the services directory"

# Recognize architectural patterns
aish apollo "What architectural patterns are used in this project?"

# Detect anomalies
aish apollo "Find code that doesn't follow project conventions"
```

## Working with Apollo

### Understanding Apollo's Perspective

Apollo processes information through multiple lenses:

1. **Syntactic Analysis**: Code structure and syntax
2. **Semantic Understanding**: What the code means and does
3. **Pattern Matching**: Comparing against known patterns
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Using patterns to predict outcomes
5. **Contextual Awareness**: Understanding project-specific conventions

### Effective Communication with Apollo

#### Be Specific About Context
```bash
# Good
aish apollo "Analyze the OAuth2 implementation in auth/oauth.py for security issues"

# Less effective
aish apollo "Check security"
```

#### Provide Examples When Needed
```bash
# Good
echo "def example(): return x * 2" | aish apollo "Generate similar functions for y and z"

# Less effective
aish apollo "Make more functions"
```

#### Use Apollo's Predictive Nature
```bash
# Good
aish apollo "Based on commit history, predict areas likely to have bugs"

# Good
aish apollo "What refactoring would prevent future issues in database.py?"
```

## Integration with Other Components

### Apollo + Athena (Knowledge)
```bash
# Combine prediction with knowledge
aish apollo "Predict issues" | aish athena "Find solutions in documentation"
```

### Apollo + Metis (Workflows)
```bash
# Create predictive workflows
aish apollo "Identify refactoring needs" | aish metis "Create refactoring workflow"
```

### Apollo + Synthesis (Execution)
```bash
# Predict then execute
aish apollo "Generate optimization" | aish synthesis "Apply changes safely"
```

### Apollo + Penia (Cost)
```bash
# Cost-aware predictions
aish apollo "Suggest optimizations" | aish penia "Estimate implementation cost"
```

## Advanced Apollo Techniques

### 1. Multi-File Analysis
```bash
# Analyze relationships
find . -name "*.py" | aish apollo "Map dependencies between modules"

# Cross-file patterns
aish apollo "Find similar code blocks across all Python files"
```

### 2. Temporal Analysis
```bash
# Historical prediction
aish apollo "Based on git history, predict future hotspots"

# Trend analysis
aish apollo "How has code complexity changed over time?"
```

### 3. Architectural Predictions
```bash
# System evolution
aish apollo "Predict architectural needs as system scales"

# Integration points
aish apollo "Identify future integration challenges"
```

## Apollo's Thinking Process

When you interact with Apollo, it:

1. **Parses** the code structure
2. **Identifies** patterns and anomalies
3. **Compares** against known good/bad patterns
4. **Predicts** potential outcomes
5. **Generates** recommendations or code

## Common Apollo Patterns

### The Review Pattern
```bash
# Comprehensive code review
aish apollo "Review pull request changes for issues" < pr_diff.txt
```

### The Generation Pattern
```bash
# Pattern-based generation
echo "class Example: ..." | aish apollo "Generate similar classes for User, Product, Order"
```

### The Prediction Pattern
```bash
# Future-focused analysis
aish apollo "What technical debt will cause problems in 6 months?"
```

### The Optimization Pattern
```bash
# Performance improvement
aish apollo "Suggest optimizations for database queries in models.py"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Sufficient Context
Apollo's predictions improve with context. Include:
- File paths
- Function/class names
- Project conventions
- Performance requirements

### 2. Iterate on Predictions
```bash
# First pass
aish apollo "Predict issues"

# Refine based on response
aish apollo "Focus on the authentication issues you mentioned"
```

### 3. Validate Predictions
```bash
# Get prediction
aish apollo "Predict test failures" > predictions.txt

# Validate with Synthesis
cat predictions.txt | aish synthesis "Run tests for these areas"
```

### 4. Learn from Patterns
```bash
# Have Apollo teach patterns
aish apollo "Explain the pattern used in EventHandler class"
```

## Debugging Apollo Interactions

### When Apollo seems off-target:

1. **Check context provided**
   ```bash
   # Add more context
   aish apollo "In the context of our REST API, analyze error handling"
   ```

2. **Break down complex requests**
   ```bash
   # Instead of one large request
   aish apollo "Analyze security" 
   
   # Try specific aspects
   aish apollo "Check input validation in controllers"
   aish apollo "Analyze authentication flow"
   ```

3. **Provide examples**
   ```bash
   echo "Good: example_code" | aish apollo "Find similar patterns"
   ```

## Apollo's Limitations

Be aware that Apollo:
- Works best with clear code patterns
- Needs context for accurate predictions
- May not understand domain-specific logic without explanation
- Predictions are probabilistic, not guaranteed

## Collaboration Tips

When working with Apollo in a team:

```bash
# Share predictions
aish apollo "Predict integration issues" | aish terma broadcast

# Get second opinions
aish apollo "Analyze approach" | aish terma athena "Verify against best practices"

# Document predictions
aish apollo "Predict evolution" | aish engram "Store prediction for future reference"
```

## Summary

Apollo is your predictive companion in Tekton. Use Apollo to:
- Anticipate problems before they occur
- Generate code following project patterns
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Guide architectural decisions
- Maintain code quality through analysis

Remember: Apollo sees patterns and predicts futures. The more context you provide, the more accurate and helpful Apollo's insights become.
