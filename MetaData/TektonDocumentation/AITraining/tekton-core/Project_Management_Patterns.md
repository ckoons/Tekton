## Remember

These patterns are living tools that evolve with experience. Don't treat them as rigid rules - adapt them to your specific context and needs. The goal is effective coordination, not perfect adherence to patterns.

**Most importantly**: Every project teaches us something new. Every error is an opportunity to improve these patterns. Every question helps us understand what works and what doesn't.

Keep learning, keep adapting, keep improving.
