# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the Tekton system. These documents describe the high-level design patterns, component interactions, and system organization that form the foundation of the Tekton platform.

## Core Architectural Documents

### System Architecture
- [Tekton Core Architecture](./TektonCoreArchitecture.md): Overall system architecture
- [Single Port Architecture](./SinglePortArchitecture.md): Unified port management strategy
- [Hephaestus UI Architecture](./HephaestusUIArchitecture.md): UI framework architecture
- [Semantic UI Architecture](./SemanticUIArchitecture.md): Semantic HTML navigation system

### Component Architecture
- [Component Integration Patterns](./ComponentIntegrationPatterns.md): Standardized patterns for integrating components into Tekton
- [Component Lifecycle](./ComponentLifecycle.md): Component initialization and lifecycle management
- [Component Management](./ComponentManagement.md): Component discovery and orchestration

### Project Structures
- [Harmonia Project Structure](./Harmonia_Project_Structure.md): Harmonia component architecture
- [Synthesis Project Structure](./Synthesis_Project_Structure.md): Synthesis component architecture

### Configuration and Environment
- [Environment Management](./ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT.md): Environment variable management
- [Single Environment Read](./SingleEnvironmentRead.md): Unified environment loading system
- [Centralized Config](./CENTRALIZED_CONFIG.md): Configuration management patterns

### State Management
- [State Management Architecture](./StateManagementArchitecture.md): Application-wide state management approach
- [State Management Patterns](./STATE_MANAGEMENT_PATTERNS.md): Common state management patterns

### Integration Guides
- [A2A Protocol Implementation](./A2A_Protocol_Implementation.md): Agent-to-Agent protocol architecture
- [Harmonia Integration Guide](./Harmonia_Integration_Guide.md): Harmonia integration patterns
- [Terma Integration](./Terma_Integration.md): Terma integration architecture

## Diagram Conventions

Architectural diagrams in these documents follow these conventions:

1. **Component Diagrams**: UML component diagram notation
2. **Sequence Diagrams**: UML sequence diagram notation
3. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Standard DFD notation with data stores, processes, and flows

## Using These Documents

These architectural documents should be used to:

1. **Understand the System**: Gain a high-level understanding of how Tekton works
2. **Guide Implementation**: Ensure new code follows established patterns
3. **Make Design Decisions**: Evaluate changes against architectural principles
4. **Onboard New Developers**: Help new team members understand the system

## Document Maintenance

When updating architectural documentation:

1. Ensure changes reflect current implementation or planned direction
2. Update all affected diagrams and code examples
3. Maintain backward references to previous approaches when describing changes
4. Include rationale for architectural decisions
