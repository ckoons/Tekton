# Connection Pool Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Connection Pool (`shared/ai/connection_pool.py`)
- Singleton pattern for global connection management
- Maintains persistent socket connections to all CIs
- Automatic reconnection on failure
- Health monitoring with periodic pings
- Connection reuse across all Tekton components

### 2. Integrated Seamlessly into Socket Client
- Modified `shared/ai/socket_client.py` to use pool automatically
- Falls back to direct connections if pool fails
- No API changes - existing code continues working
- Lazy initialization to avoid event loop issues

### 3. Optimized Team Chat
- Reduced default timeout from 10s to 2s
- Capped connection timeout at 0.5s
- Disabled retries for faster failures
- Connection pool used transparently

### 4. Fixed Event Loop Issue
- Changed from eager to lazy initialization
- Prevents "no running event loop" error in sync contexts
- Works in both async and sync environments

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- New TCP connection for each message
- Connection overhead: 100-500ms per AI
- Team chat waits for all: up to 36 seconds

### After  
- Connections reused from pool
- Connection overhead: 0ms (after first use)
- Fast failures: 2 second timeout per AI
- Streaming responses: see results immediately

## How It Works

```
Component starts → Pool initializes lazily on first use
                           ↓
AI message sent → Check pool → Reuse existing connection
                      ↓              ↓
                  Not found → Create & cache connection
                      ↓
                  Response → Update metrics → Return
```

## Files Modified

1. `/shared/ai/connection_pool.py` - New connection pool implementation
2. `/shared/ai/socket_client.py` - Modified to use pool transparently
3. `/shared/ai/specialist_worker.py` - Pre-initializes pool on startup
4. `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/team_chat_endpoints.py` - Reduced timeouts
5. `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/mcp/tools_integration_unified.py` - Timeout optimization

## No Changes Required

The connection pool works transparently. No existing code needs modification:
- aish continues to work
- UI components continue to work
- All APIs remain the same

## Configuration

Environment variables (optional):
```bash
TEKTON_POOL_HEALTH_INTERVAL=30    # Health check interval
TEKTON_POOL_RECONNECT_DELAY=5     # Reconnection delay
TEKTON_POOL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=2  # Connection timeout
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor connection pool performance in production
2. Add metrics/logging for connection reuse stats
3. Consider WebSocket upgrade for even better performance
4. Implement connection pooling for Ollama connections
