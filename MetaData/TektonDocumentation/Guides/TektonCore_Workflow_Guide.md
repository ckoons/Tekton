# TektonCore Workflow Guide

## Philosophy

**"Errors are gold, they help us improve. Questions that are sincere are the best ways to communicate. We evolve, change and hope to improve. If you stumble, get up and get back in the race, you can win."**

This guide describes the complete workflow for managing multi-CI development projects through TektonCore. It's a living document that evolves as we learn and improve our coordination processes.
