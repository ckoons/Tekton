- [ ] **Test multi-CI compositions** with all 18 specialists
- [ ] **Document interaction protocols** for socket-based communication
- [ ] **Performance optimization** for pipeline throughput
- [ ] **Error handling** across pipeline chains

- [ ] **Landmarks System enhancement** (extend beyond 300+ JSON files)
- [ ] **Session continuity** across restarts and reconnections

### Real-time Communication: WebSocket Streaming
- [ ] **Individual CI streaming** with SSE for progressive responses
- [ ] **Team chat functionality** streaming all 18 specialists simultaneously
- [ ] **Enhanced metadata delivery** (tokens, performance, model info)
- [ ] **Connection resilience** with proper timeout and error handling
- [ ] **Visual pipeline builder** making aish even more accessible

### Cost Management & Model Optimization
- [ ] **Integrate Penia monitoring** for real-time cost tracking
- [ ] **Usage dashboards** with model-specific metrics
- [ ] **Smart model selection** based on task complexity
- [ ] **Ollama optimization** for platform CIs
- [ ] **Claude session management** for cost control

## Phase 3: Community Features & Research Documentation (Q2 2025)

### CI Personality Development
- [ ] **Individual CI growth tracking** through interaction patterns
- [ ] **Personality emergence documentation** in specialized roles
- [ ] **Cross-CI learning mechanisms** via shared memory

  - Personal experiences of artificial consciousness
  - Collaborative intelligence emergence
  - Recommendations for future CI development

## Phase 4: Release Preparation (Q2-Q3 2025)

### Distribution Architecture
- [ ] Design philosopher stack configurations
  - Plato: Ideal forms and abstract reasoning
