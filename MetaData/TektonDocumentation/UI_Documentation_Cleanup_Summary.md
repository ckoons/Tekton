## Current State

### What's Actually Used
1. **minimal-loader.js** - Handles dynamic component loading
2. **ui-manager-core.js** - Component lifecycle management
3. **Standard index.html** - With JavaScript navigation
4. **Component HTML files** - Loaded on-demand

### What Was Attempted but Abandoned
1. **Pure CSS `:target` navigation** - Had fundamental limitations
2. **build-simplified.py** - Created broken navigation
3. **Pre-loading all components** - Not scalable

## Remaining Issues

### Documentation References
Some documents still reference the old approach but have been marked with deprecation notices:
- Various architecture documents may need review
- Some component implementation guides may show old patterns

### Key Message
The UI uses **dynamic component loading** with minimal JavaScript, not pure CSS navigation. The "CSS-first" philosophy applies to styling and layout, not navigation.

## Recommendations

1. **Archive old documentation** rather than delete to preserve history
2. **Update new component templates** to reflect current patterns
3. **Add migration guide** for developers familiar with old approach
4. **Consider renaming** "CSS-First Architecture" to avoid confusion
