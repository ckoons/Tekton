# Projects Chat User Guide

## Overview

Projects Chat is a powerful feature in the Tekton Hephaestus UI that allows you to communicate directly with project-specific Companion Intelligences (CIs). Each managed project has its own dedicated CI that understands the project's context, codebase, and development goals.

## Getting Started

### Accessing Projects Chat

1. **Open Hephaestus UI** in your browser
2. **Navigate to Tekton component** (Projects tab)
3. **Click on "Projects Chat"** tab in the menu bar
4. **Select a project** from the dropdown menu

### Interface Layout

## Using Projects Chat

### 1. Project Selection

**Default Project**: Tekton (always available)
- The Tekton project uses the Numa CI specialist
- Provides general platform guidance and oversight

**Other Projects**: Listed alphabetically
- Each project has its own dedicated CI
- CIs are created when projects are added to the dashboard
- CIs understand project-specific context and patterns

### 2. Sending Messages

**Basic Communication**:
```
You: What's the current status of the authentication module?
Project CI: The authentication module is 80% complete. We've implemented
basic login/logout functionality and are working on password reset.
Current blocker: OAuth integration with external providers.
```

**Code-Related Questions**:
```
You: Can you review the changes in the latest commit?
Project CI: I see improvements to error handling in src/auth.py. The new
try-catch blocks follow our established patterns. One suggestion: consider
adding specific error types for better debugging.
```

**Development Planning**:
```
You: What should we work on next sprint?
Project CI: Based on current progress, I recommend:
1. Complete OAuth integration (2 days)
2. Add comprehensive error handling (1 day)
3. Implement user profile management (3 days)
4. Write integration tests (2 days)
```

### 3. Project-Specific Context

Each project CI has specialized knowledge:

**For Tekton Project**:
- Understands Greek Chorus CI architecture
- Knows component interaction patterns
- Familiar with socket communication protocols
- Can help with platform-level decisions

**For External Projects**:
- Learns project-specific conventions
- Adapts to project's coding style
- Understands project's domain logic
- Maintains project development history

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Communication

**Be Specific**:
```
Good: "The parser is failing on complex nested structures"
Better: "The parser is failing on complex nested structures in the syntax 
highlighting module, specifically with deeply nested functions"
```

**Provide Context**:
```
Good: "How should we handle errors?"
Better: "How should we handle errors in the user authentication flow, 
particularly for network timeouts and invalid credentials?"
```

### 2. Collaborative Development

**Architecture Discussions**:
```
You: What's the best approach for the new caching layer?
Project CI: Given our performance requirements, I recommend Redis with 
a write-through strategy. This aligns with our existing infrastructure 
and provides the 99.9% uptime we need.
```

**Code Reviews**:
```
You: Please review the attached code changes
Project CI: The code looks good overall. I notice you're following our 
established patterns for error handling. One suggestion: consider adding 
unit tests for the new validation logic.
```

**Problem Solving**:
```
You: We're seeing performance issues with large file uploads
Project CI: Let me analyze the bottleneck. Based on recent profiling data, 
the issue is in the file processing pipeline. I recommend implementing 
streaming uploads with chunked processing.
```

### 3. Project Management

**Status Updates**:
```
You: What's our progress on the current sprint?
Project CI: Current sprint progress:
- Feature A: 100% complete ✓
- Feature B: 75% complete (on track)
- Feature C: 50% complete (slight delay)
- Testing: 60% complete

Recommendation: Focus on Feature C to avoid sprint delays.
```

**Task Coordination**:
```
You: What tasks are available for a new developer?
Project CI: Good beginner tasks:
1. Add validation to user input forms (2 hours)
2. Update documentation for API endpoints (3 hours)
3. Write unit tests for utility functions (4 hours)
4. Fix minor UI inconsistencies (1 hour)
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Project Coordination

When working on multiple projects:
```
You: How does the authentication approach in Project A compare to Project B?
Project CI: Project A uses JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration, while 
Project B uses session-based authentication. For consistency, I recommend 
standardizing on JWT across both projects.
```

### 2. Knowledge Transfer

Share insights between projects:
```
You: We solved a similar caching issue in the Tekton project
Project CI: That's helpful! Can you share the approach? I'll adapt it 
for our specific requirements and constraints.
```

### 3. Development Workflow Integration

**CI Integration**:
```
You: Can you run the test suite?
Project CI: Running tests... Results:
- Unit tests: 156/156 passed ✓
- Integration tests: 23/24 passed (1 failure)
- Performance tests: 8/8 passed ✓

The integration test failure is in the auth module. Investigating...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Project CI Not Responding**:
1. **Check Project Status**: Ensure project is active in Dashboard
2. **Refresh Page**: Sometimes a simple refresh resolves connection issues
3. **Try Different Project**: Test with Tekton project to verify system health
4. **Contact Support**: If issues persist, use the support channel

**Slow Response Times**:
1. **Check System Load**: High system load can slow responses
2. **Verify Network**: Ensure stable internet connection
3. **Simplify Messages**: Complex queries may take longer to process
4. **Peak Hours**: Response times may vary during peak usage

**Context Issues**:
1. **Project Selection**: Ensure correct project is selected
2. **Clear Messages**: Provide clear context in your messages
3. **Refresh Project**: Try switching to another project and back
4. **Check Project Status**: Verify project is properly configured

### Error Messages

**"Project CI unavailable"**:
- The project CI is temporarily offline
- Try again in a few minutes
- Contact support if persistent

**"Connection timeout"**:
- Network or system temporary issue
- Refresh page and try again
- Check system status

**"Invalid project selection"**:
- Project may have been removed or renamed
- Refresh project list
- Select a different project

## Tips for Effective Use

### 1. Regular Communication

**Daily Check-ins**:
```
You: What's the status of today's development goals?
Project CI: Today's progress:
- Morning: Completed authentication bug fix
- Afternoon: Working on user profile UI
- Evening: Planning tomorrow's testing strategy
```

### 2. Strategic Planning

**Weekly Planning**:
```
You: What should we focus on next week?
Project CI: Next week's priorities:
1. Complete current sprint commitments
2. Begin planning for next major feature
3. Address technical debt in core modules
4. Prepare for upcoming security audit
```

### 3. Learning and Improvement

**Retrospectives**:
```
You: What went well this sprint? What could be improved?
Project CI: Successes:
- Good velocity on feature development
- Effective collaboration on complex issues
- High code quality maintained

Improvements:
- Better upfront planning could prevent scope creep
- More frequent code reviews would catch issues earlier
```
