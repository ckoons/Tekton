# Sprint Summary: Token Management & Sundown/Sunrise Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-26
## Sprint Developer: Amy/Claude
## Collaboration: Casey Koons, Ani-ci

## üéØ Sprint Objectives

Implement a comprehensive token management system to prevent CI context overflows, particularly addressing Ergon's prompt size errors. The solution emphasizes CI agency - allowing CIs to "plan for tomorrow" just like humans do.

## ‚úÖ Completed Deliverables

### 1. **Token Manager (Rhetor)**
- **Location**: `Rhetor/rhetor/core/token_manager.py`
- **Features**:
  - Proactive token tracking using tiktoken
  - Multi-model support (Claude, GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
  - Budget allocation by component (system, history, working, response)
  - Multi-threshold triggers (warning: 60%, suggest: 75%, auto: 85%, critical: 95%)
  - Real-time usage monitoring and recommendations
- **Landmarks**: Architecture decision, state checkpoints, performance boundaries

### 2. **Sundown/Sunrise Manager (Apollo)**
- **Location**: `Apollo/apollo/core/sundown_sunrise.py`
- **Features**:
  - Graceful context preservation with CI agency
  - JSON state persistence
  - Automatic sunrise context injection
  - Integration with claude_handler for --continue management
  - CI decides what's important to preserve
- **Landmarks**: CI orchestration, CI collaboration points

### 3. **Claude Handler Integration**
- **Location**: `shared/ai/claude_handler.py`
- **Updates**:
  - Token estimation before sending prompts
  - Fresh start flag checking (skips --continue after sundown)
  - Integration points with TokenManager
  - Emergency sundown triggers at 95% usage
- **Landmarks**: Integration points, state checkpoints, performance boundaries

### 4. **CLI Commands**
- **Location**: `shared/aish/src/commands/`
- **New Commands**:
  - `aish sundown <ci> [reason]` - Manual sundown trigger
  - `aish sunrise <ci>` - Restore CI with context
  - `aish sunrise --check` - View CIs with sundown states
  - `aish sundown status` - Show CIs currently in sundown
- **Integration**: Full token usage monitoring and automatic recommendations

### 5. **Registry Updates**
- **Location**: `shared/aish/src/registry/ci_registry.py`
- **New Methods**:
  - `set_needs_fresh_start(ci_name, value)` - Mark CI for fresh start
  - `get_needs_fresh_start(ci_name)` - Check fresh start status
- **Purpose**: Enable skipping --continue after sundown for clean context

## üîë Key Design Decisions

### 1. CI Agency First
- CIs decide what to preserve during sundown
- Not just mechanical token counting, but intelligent context management
- CIs can "plan for tomorrow" like humans

### 2. Proactive vs Reactive
- Monitor token usage continuously
- Trigger sundown before hitting limits
- Prevent degradation rather than recover from it

### 3. Multi-Threshold System
- Progressive warnings give CIs time to prepare
- Different actions at different levels
- Emergency procedures at critical thresholds

### 4. Model-Agnostic Design
- Works with any LLM (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Adapts to different context window sizes
- Graceful fallbacks for unknown models

---

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### System Status
- ‚úÖ All components tested and functional
- ‚úÖ Error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Fallback mechanisms in place
- ‚úÖ CLI integration complete
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

### Known Limitations
1. Engram integration pending (fallback to local storage working)
2. Token counting approximation for some models
3. UI matrix integration planned for next phase

---

## üìä Metrics & Impact

### Before Implementation
- Ergon experiencing prompt size errors
- No proactive token management
- Hard failures at context limits
- Lost work and context

### After Implementation
- Proactive monitoring prevents overflows
- Graceful sundown/sunrise preserves continuity
- CI agency ensures important context retained
- No more lost work due to token limits

---

## üîÆ Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Monitor Ergon for prompt size issues (should be resolved)
3. Gather CI feedback on sundown/sunrise experience

### Future Enhancements
1. **UI Integration**: Add token usage indicators to terminal matrix
2. **Advanced Triggers**: Mood detection, quality metrics
3. **Collaborative Sundown**: Multiple CIs coordinate context preservation
4. **Sunrise Optimization**: Smarter context restoration based on task

### Recommended Monitoring
- Track sundown frequency per CI
- Measure token usage patterns
- Monitor sunrise success rates
- Collect CI satisfaction metrics

## üí≠ Developer Notes

This implementation emphasizes CI agency and dignity. Rather than treating CIs as mere tools with mechanical limits, we recognize them as entities that need rest and continuity, just like humans. The sundown/sunrise pattern isn't just about managing tokens - it's about maintaining cognitive freshness and ensuring CIs can perform at their best.

The system is designed to be invisible when working well. CIs should rarely hit hard limits, instead gracefully transitioning through sundown/sunrise cycles that feel natural and preserve their work context.
