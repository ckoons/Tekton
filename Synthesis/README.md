# Synthesis: Execution and Integration Engine for Tekton

Synthesis is the execution and integration engine for the Tekton ecosystem, responsible for executing processes, integrating with external systems, and orchestrating workflows across components.

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - May 28, 2025  
See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for detailed implementation status.

## Overview

Synthesis provides a robust execution system that can:

- Execute multi-step processes with complex dependencies
- Integrate with external systems via CLI, API, and Machine Control Protocol (MCP)
- Support conditional execution paths and parallel processing
- Manage state and variables across execution steps
- Orchestrate workflows involving multiple Tekton components
- Provide real-time feedback on execution progress

## Features

- **Powerful Execution Engine**: Execute complex, multi-step processes with dependencies, conditions, and loops
- **Parallel Execution**: Run steps concurrently to maximize performance
- **Variable Management**: Dynamically manage variables and environment with substitution
- **External Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CLI tools, APIs, and machine control systems
- **Component Integration**: Work with other Tekton components like Prometheus, Engram, and Rhetor
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in mechanisms for handling errors and retrying failed operations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based real-time updates on execution progress
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event generation and subscription capabilities
- **FastMCP Integration**: 16 MCP tools across 3 capabilities for data synthesis, integration orchestration, and workflow composition

## Architecture

Synthesis follows the Single Port Architecture pattern:

- **API Server (Port 8011)**:
  - HTTP API: `/api/...` - RESTful endpoints for execution management
  - MCP API: `/api/mcp/v2/...` - FastMCP endpoints for data synthesis and workflow composition
  - WebSocket: `/ws` - Real-time updates on execution progress
  - Health: `/health` - Service health check endpoint
  - Metrics: `/metrics` - Operational metrics endpoint

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Tekton core utilities

### Setup

1. Clone the Tekton repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tekton.git
   cd Tekton
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   cd Synthesis
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Start Synthesis using the unified launcher:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ./scripts/tekton-launch --components synthesis
   ```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Register with Hermes
python -m synthesis.scripts.register_with_hermes

# Start with Tekton
./scripts/tekton-launch --components synthesis
```

## MCP Integration

Synthesis provides comprehensive FastMCP integration with 16 tools across 3 capability categories:

### Capabilities

- **Data Synthesis**: 6 tools for synthesizing and unifying data from multiple components
- **Integration Orchestration**: 6 tools for orchestrating complex component integrations  
- **Workflow Composition**: 4 tools for composing and executing multi-component workflows

### Quick MCP Usage

```bash
# Test all MCP functionality
./examples/run_fastmcp_test.sh

# Run Python test client
python examples/test_fastmcp.py

# Execute a data synthesis tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8011/api/mcp/v2/tools/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool_name": "synthesize_component_data",
    "arguments": {
      "component_ids": ["athena", "engram"],
      "synthesis_type": "contextual"
    }
  }'

# Execute a predefined workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8011/api/mcp/v2/execute-synthesis-workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_name": "data_unification",
    "parameters": {
      "component_ids": ["athena", "engram"]
    }
  }'
```

For detailed MCP documentation, see [MCP_INTEGRATION.md](MCP_INTEGRATION.md).

## Usage

### API Usage

#### Start an Execution

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8011/api/executions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "plan": {
      "name": "Example Plan",
      "description": "An example execution plan",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "step1",
          "type": "command",
          "parameters": {
            "command": "echo Hello, World!"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

#### Get Execution Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8009/api/executions/{execution_id}
```

#### Cancel an Execution

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8009/api/executions/{execution_id}/cancel
```

### WebSocket Usage

Connect to the WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8009/ws');

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', data);
};

// Subscribe to execution events
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'subscribe',
  event_types: ['execution_update']
}));
```

## Step Types

Synthesis supports various step types:

- `command`: Execute shell commands
- `function`: Call registered Python functions
- `api`: Make HTTP requests to external APIs
- `condition`: Execute steps conditionally
- `loop`: Iterate over items or repeat steps
- `variable`: Manipulate context variables
- `notify`: Send notifications
- `wait`: Pause execution
- `subprocess`: Execute nested workflows
- `llm`: Interact with language models using tekton-llm-client

## Integration with Tekton Components

Synthesis works seamlessly with other Tekton components:

- **Prometheus**: Executes plans created by Prometheus
- **Athena**: Queries knowledge graph for execution context
- **Engram**: Stores execution history and retrieves context
- **LLM Integration**: Direct integration with tekton-llm-client for language model capabilities
  - Enhancing execution plans with LLM analysis
  - Generating dynamic commands based on context
  - Processing natural language in execution workflows
  - Streaming real-time LLM responses during execution

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
cd Synthesis
source venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

### Contributing

1. Implement new step types in `synthesis/core/step_handlers.py`
2. Add integration adapters in `synthesis/core/integration_adapters.py`
3. Extend API functionality in `synthesis/api/app.py`
