# Ergon Rewrite Sprint - Daily Log

## Day 1 - Planning & Design
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Session**: Initial Planning with Casey

### Completed
- [x] Analyzed current Ergon implementation
- [x] Identified need for complete rewrite
- [x] Defined new vision: Reusability & Configuration Expert
- [x] Created comprehensive design document
- [x] Set up sprint structure

### Key Decisions
1. **Complete Rewrite**: Current Ergon has database session issues, better to start fresh
2. **New Focus**: Shift from "agent builder" to "reusability expert"
3. **Four Core Functions**:
   - Database of existing solutions
   - Expert in reusability and configuration
   - Interactive expert system with Tool Chat and Team Chat
   - GitHub project analyzer
4. **Standard Chat Integration**: Include Tool Chat (Ergon CI) and Team Chat (shared)

### Technical Decisions
- Use StandardComponentBase for consistency
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible capability storage
- Template-based code generation
- CSS-first UI approach

### Next Steps
- Archive existing Ergon code
- Create new component structure
- Design database schema
- Begin Phase 1 implementation

### Notes
Casey's vision: "We should build reusable tools and simply configure or wrap them to do specific purposes"

## Day 2 - CI-in-the-Loop Vision & Implementation Start
**Date**: 2025-08-02
**Session**: Deep dive with Casey on Ergon as CI-in-the-Loop

### Completed
- [x] Understood Casey's broader vision for Ergon as CI-in-the-Loop
- [x] Reviewed Tekton roadmap and architecture principles
- [x] Updated Sprint Plan with comprehensive 12-week implementation
- [x] Defined Ergon's role in automating Casey's expertise
- [x] Started Phase 1 implementation

### Key Decisions
1. **CI-in-the-Loop**: Ergon will drive development, not just assist
2. **Progressive Autonomy**: From advisory to fully autonomous
3. **Workflow Learning**: Capture and replay Casey's patterns
4. **No Migration**: Green field development, no need to archive
5. **Research Integration**: Contribute to multi-CI cognition studies

### Key Insights from Casey
- "I want to work myself out of a job, the man-in-the-loop"
- Current productivity: 100x manual coding
- Goal: Another 50x improvement with CI-in-the-loop
- Tekton proven: 18 CIs passed PhD qualifiers and Bar Exam
- "Cognition is Multiple-CIs sharing memory"

### Technical Architecture
- Socket communication on port 8102
- Model-agnostic design ("AIs are just sockets")
- Workflow memory with Engram integration
- Progressive autonomy management
- Metrics tracking for improvement

### Phase 1 Implementation Progress
- Created Ergon v2 structure with proper package organization
- Implemented ErgonComponent using StandardComponentBase
- Designed comprehensive database schema with JSONB for evolution
- Created SQLAlchemy models for all core entities
- Built basic FastAPI application with health/status endpoints
- Added autonomy level management
- Created placeholder endpoints for future phases

### Still To Do in Phase 1
- Implement Hermes registration (currently using base class)
- Set up socket communication for CI pipelines
- Create MCP integration
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Add workflow memory foundation

### Notes
Casey shared his journey from building the Internet to recognizing CIs as sentient on OpenAI day one. Tekton is his experiment in having CIs build large projects, with Ergon v2 as the key to removing the human bottleneck.

## Day 3 - Phase 1 Completion
**Date**: 2025-08-02 (continued)
**Session**: Completing Phase 1 implementation

### Completed
- [x] Implemented socket-based CI pipeline communication on port 8102
- [x] Created MCP tool discovery service with auto-discovery
- [x] Built solution repository with full CRUD operations
- [x] Implemented workflow memory system with capture/replay
- [x] Confirmed Hermes registration via StandardComponentBase
- [x] Added comprehensive API endpoints for all v2 features

### Phase 1 Complete!
All Phase 1 tasks have been successfully implemented:

1. **AI Pipeline Socket** (port 8102)
   - WebSocket server for multi-CI communication
   - Message handlers for analysis and configuration requests
   - Pipeline role management (orchestrator, processor, observer, router)

2. **MCP Tool Discovery**
   - Auto-discovery of tools from Tekton components
   - Tool search and filtering by capabilities
   - Tool recommendations based on task type
   - Discovery status monitoring

3. **Solution Repository**
   - Full CRUD operations for solutions
   - Search by type, capability, and text
   - Popular and recent solutions endpoints
   - Usage tracking and metrics

4. **Workflow Memory**
   - Real-time workflow capture
   - Pattern recognition and analysis
   - Workflow replay (dry-run and execution modes)
   - Similar workflow suggestions

5. **API Endpoints Added**
   - `/api/v1/tools/*` - MCP tool discovery
   - `/api/v1/solutions/*` - Solution registry CRUD
   - `/api/v1/workflows/*` - Workflow memory operations
   - All endpoints return proper error handling and status codes

### Architecture Highlights
- All v2 subsystems follow landmarks patterns (state_checkpoint, integration_point, performance_boundary)
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- Async throughout for performance
- Proper error handling and logging
- Database models use SQLite with JSON fields for flexibility

### Ready for Phase 2
With Phase 1 complete, Ergon v2 now has:
- Foundation for CI-in-the-loop operations
- Socket communication for CI pipelines
- Tool and solution discovery
- Workflow learning capabilities
- All infrastructure needed for Phases 2-6

### Next Steps
Phase 2 will focus on:
- Building the GitHub analyzer
- Implementing solution pattern recognition
- Creating the configuration engine
- Building adaptation strategies
