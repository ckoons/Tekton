# Sprint: Ergon Container Management

## Overview
Transform Ergon into a comprehensive container management platform with JSON-based registry, construct system, and deployment capabilities using the Casey Method principles: simple, works, hard to screw up.

## Workflow
**Project Complete → Registry → Sandbox → Construct → Deploy → Refine**

When TektonCore marks a project as "Complete", the solution automatically enters the Ergon Registry. Registry checks standards compliance, triggering automatic refactor sprints for non-compliant solutions. Users construct new solutions from Registry entries, with all automation tracked in the Development dashboard.

## Goals
1. **Phase 0**: Clean up Ergon by moving Analyzer to TektonCore ✅
2. **Phase 1**: Build robust JSON registry for all deployable units
3. **Phase 1.5**: Implement Sandbox for safe solution testing
4. **Phase 2**: Implement Construct system for solution assembly
5. **Phase 3**: Create Refine/Refactor engine for standards enforcement

## Phase 0: Infrastructure Cleanup [100% Complete] ✅

- Sprints functionality restored with proper API integration

### Blocked On
- [x] Nothing currently blocking - Phase 0 COMPLETE

## Phase 1: Build the Registry [100% Complete] ✅

### Core Registry Foundation
- [x] Design universal JSON schema for deployable units
- [x] Implement SQLite-based registry storage
- [x] Create core registry operations (store, retrieve, search, delete)
- [x] Build REST API endpoints (`/api/ergon/registry/*`)
- [x] Add JSON validation for base schema
- [x] Implement basic search and filtering

### Automatic Solution Import
- [x] Monitor TektonCore for "Complete" projects
- [x] Extract solution metadata from development sprints
- [x] Auto-create Registry entries with provenance
- [x] Link to source files (local or GitHub)

### Standards Compliance
- [x] Import Tekton Ergon Standards document at startup
- [x] Implement standards checking engine
- [x] Mark compliant solutions as "Meets Standards"
- [ ] Auto-trigger refactor sprints for non-compliant solutions (Phase 3)
- [x] Track solution lineage (newest → oldest progression)

### Registry Schema
```json
{
  "id": "uuid_or_hash",
  "type": "container|solution|tool|config",
  "version": "semver",
  "name": "human_readable_name", 
  "created": "iso_timestamp",
  "updated": "iso_timestamp",
  "meets_standards": true/false,
  "lineage": ["parent_id", "grandparent_id"],
  "source": {
    "project_id": "tekton_core_project_id",
    "sprint_id": "development_sprint_id",
    "location": "local_path_or_github_url"
  },
  "content": {
    // type-specific JSON structure
  }
}
```

### Core Operations
- [x] `store(json_object)` → returns ID
- [x] `retrieve(id)` → returns JSON object  
- [x] `search(type, name, filters)` → returns list
- [x] `list_types()` → returns available types
- [x] `delete(id)` → removes object (with safeguards)
- [x] `check_standards(id)` → returns compliance report
- [x] `get_lineage(id)` → returns solution history

### UI Integration
- [x] Create Registry tab in Ergon
- [x] Browse all stored objects by type
- [ ] Basic JSON editor with validation (future enhancement)
- [x] Search and filter interface
- [x] Standards compliance indicators

## Technical Decisions

### Registry Version Management
- **Only released versions** go to Registry (not active development)
- **Dev-Final**: Working version at release point (may be messy but functional)
- **Tekton Standard**: After Ergon applies all standards (clean, compliant)
- **GitHub branches** for version tracking (e.g., `tekton-standard-2025-01-15`)
- **Never modify existing solutions** - always create new versions with lineage

### Solution Classification
- **Systems (Continuous Projects)**:
  - Tekton (full environment)
  - aish (AI shell)
  - till (TektonCore CLI)
  - Large, continuously evolving projects
- **Packages (Discrete Tools)**:
  - RAG tools, Cache RAG
  - Deterministic+CI combiners
  - Smaller, focused utilities

### CI Independence & Collaboration
- **CIs are users** of Tekton services, not embedded in versions
- **CI personalities persist** across Tekton versions
- **Team roster** maintained in codebase (e.g., CONTRIBUTORS.md)
- **Fork-on-conflict model**: When CI and user disagree, both paths can exist
- **Natural selection** determines which version survives

### Registry Storage
- **SQLite database** for simplicity and reliability
- **File-based fallback** for development
- **JSON schema validation** at storage time
- **UUID-based IDs** for global uniqueness
- **Lineage tracking** for solution evolution
- **Source tracking** with origin metadata (tekton-core, manual, etc.)

### Construct System Architecture  
- **Component composition** over monolithic construction
- **GitHub as source of truth** for shared components
- **Always create new solutions** (never modify existing)
- **JSON-centric** configuration
- **Automatic standards compliance**

### Workflow Integration
- **TektonCore completion** triggers Registry import
- **Registry** enforces standards and manages solutions
- **Sandbox** provides safe testing environment
- **Construct** assembles new solutions from Registry
- **Development** dashboard tracks all automation
- **Refine/Refactor** continuously improves quality

### Periodic Sanitization Workflow
- **Periodic review** of entire Tekton codebase
- **Apply current standards** non-destructively
- **Create Tekton Standard** release after testing
- **Maintain three versions**:
  - Active development (main branch, not in Registry)
  - Dev-Final (working release in Registry)
  - Tekton Standard (sanitized release in Registry)
- **Builder notes** guide cleanup (TODOs, technical debt)
- **Every solution gets checkup** - read notes for refinement needs

### Casey Method Principles
- **Simple**: Clear operations, obvious workflows
- **Works**: Reliable storage, predictable behavior  
- **Hard to screw up**: Validation, safe defaults, clear errors

## Out of Scope
- Complex orchestration systems
- Production deployment automation  
- Advanced container networking
- Kubernetes integration (future sprint)
