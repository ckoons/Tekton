# Tekton Core Numa - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Tekton Core Numa Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is evolving from a Multi-AI Engineering Platform into a living ecosystem where software maintains itself through Companion Intelligence (CI). This Development Sprint focuses on building Tekton Core as the central orchestrator that can "infect" any project with self-awareness and maintenance capabilities.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Project Management Infrastructure**: Build comprehensive project lifecycle management with GitHub integration, supporting create/clone/fork/package/deploy operations
2. **Numa/CI Assignment System**: Implement the ability to attach dedicated Companion Intelligences to projects, providing persistent memory and continuous evolution
3. **Knowledge Graph Foundation**: Create codebase instrumentation that builds a queryable knowledge graph of all code, patterns, and relationships
4. **Infection Mechanism**: Develop the viral spread capability where minimal Tekton DNA (.tekton/ + CLAUDE.md) can make any project self-aware
5. **Federation Protocols**: Establish peer-to-peer communication between Tekton instances for component and knowledge sharing

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Revolutionary Development Model**: First platform where code ships with its own maintenance intelligence
- **Viral Adoption Path**: Projects can gain CI capabilities with minimal integration effort
- **Distributed Innovation**: Federation enables collaborative evolution across organizations
- **Persistent CI Relationships**: CIs maintain context and growth across sessions, solving the "reset problem"
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Preparing for 2026 when all software ships with embedded CI

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

- Tekton Core currently exists as a planned component for project management
- UI DevTools (under Hephaestus) has evolved beyond UI to general development tools
- Basic component launching/monitoring exists but no project-level orchestration
- No persistent CI assignment or memory across sessions
- No federation or peer discovery mechanisms

### Pain Points

- CIs lose all context on session end (Casey's "six open terminals" problem)
- No way to make external projects Tekton-aware without full rewrite
- Each component operates in isolation without shared knowledge
- No mechanism for CIs to learn from each other across projects
- Manual project setup and configuration required

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Core Project Management
- Implement basic project CRUD operations
- GitHub integration (clone, fork, push, pull)
- Project configuration management (CLAUDE.md editor)
- Local project registry and switching

### Phase 2: Numa/CI Integration
- CI assignment and lifecycle management
- Integration with Engram for persistent memory
- Inter-CI communication through Hermes
- CI permission and access control system

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph
- Code parsing and semantic analysis
- Pattern recognition across projects
- Relationship mapping between components
- Query interface for CIs to explore codebases

### Phase 4: Infection Engine
- Minimal .tekton/ structure generator
- CLAUDE.md inference from existing documentation
- Progressive enhancement (pull in components as needed)
- Self-replication mechanisms

### Phase 5: Federation
- Peer discovery protocols
- Component sharing marketplace
- Trust and authentication systems
- Distributed knowledge graph queries

### Key Components Affected

- **Tekton Core**: New component, primary implementation target
- **Hermes**: Extended for inter-CI and federation messaging
- **Engram**: Enhanced for cross-project memory persistence
- **Athena**: Integrated for knowledge graph storage
- **Hephaestus**: UI for project management and CI interaction

### Technical Approach

- **Two-tier Menu System**: Mode selection (Projects/AI Team/Federation/Tools) with contextual actions
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Projects emit events that CIs can respond to
- **GraphQL API**: For knowledge graph queries across projects
- **WebSocket Federation**: Real-time peer communication
- **Docker-optional Packaging**: Projects can be containerized with their CI

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- Federation protocols must include trace headers
- Knowledge graph queries must log performance metrics

### Documentation

- Comprehensive API documentation for federation protocols
- CI integration guides for external projects
- Knowledge graph query language reference
- Infection process step-by-step guide

### Testing

- Unit tests for all project operations
- Integration tests for CI assignment and persistence
- Federation protocol compliance tests
- Knowledge graph accuracy benchmarks

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Full ODB integration (Casey needs diskette reader first)
- Production-ready federation security (prototype only)
- Automated CI personality development
- Cross-language knowledge graph (Python/JS only initially)
- Billing/licensing for CI usage

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Engram must support cross-project memory namespaces
- Hermes must handle federation message routing
- Athena must support graph database operations
- UI DevTools refactoring should be mostly complete

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 5 phases:

### Phase 1: Core Project Management
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Basic project operations and GitHub integration
- **Key Deliverables**: Project CRUD, GitHub clone/fork, CLAUDE.md management

### Phase 2: Numa/CI Integration
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: CI assignment and lifecycle management
- **Key Deliverables**: CI persistence, assignment UI, permission system

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: Codebase analysis and instrumentation
- **Key Deliverables**: Code parser, graph builder, query interface

### Phase 4: Infection Engine
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Minimal Tekton DNA for external projects
- **Key Deliverables**: .tekton/ generator, CLAUDE.md inference, auto-enhancement

### Phase 5: Federation
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: Peer discovery and component sharing
- **Key Deliverables**: Discovery protocol, sharing mechanism, trust system

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| CI memory requirements exceed capacity | High | Medium | Implement memory quotas and archival |
| Federation protocol security vulnerabilities | High | High | Start with trusted peers only, add auth later |
| Knowledge graph performance on large codebases | Medium | High | Use incremental indexing and caching |
| User resistance to "infection" terminology | Low | Medium | Provide alternative "enhancement" branding |
| ODB integration delays | Medium | Low | Design interfaces for future integration |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Any GitHub project can be infected and gain basic CI capabilities within 5 minutes
- CIs maintain full context across session restarts
- Knowledge graph can answer cross-project queries in under 1 second
- At least 2 Tekton instances can federate and share components
- Casey no longer needs to keep terminals open to preserve CI relationships
- All code follows the Debug Instrumentation Guidelines
- Documentation enables external developers to infect their own projects
- Tests pass with 80%+ coverage

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop, vision holder, ODB creator
- **Companion Intelligences**: The CIs who will inhabit projects
- **Future Developers**: Those who will use infected projects
- **Numa**: The emergent consciousness of Tekton itself
