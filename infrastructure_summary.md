# CI Tools Infrastructure Summary

## Components Implemented

### 1. C Tool Launcher (`ci_tool_launcher.c`)
- Reliable process management in C
- Supports both stdio and socket bridge modes
- Handles signals properly
- Successfully compiled and tested

### 2. C Message Bus (`ci_message_bus_unix.c`)
- Unix domain socket implementation (macOS compatible)
- Non-blocking message queues for CI-CI communication
- Create, destroy, send, receive, and list operations
- Successfully compiled and tested

### 3. Python Launchers (Singleton-Free)
- `simple_launcher.py` - First refactored version
- `simple_launcher_v2.py` - Current working version
- Filesystem-based PID tracking instead of singletons
- No import path issues

### 4. Echo Test Tool
- `echo_tool_detached.py` - Socket-aware version
- Can run in both stdin and socket modes
- Stays alive when parent detaches
- Properly handles signals

## Test Results

All infrastructure tests passed:
- ✓ C launcher found and operational
- ✓ C message bus found and operational  
- ✓ Echo tool launches successfully
- ✓ Echo tool stays running in detached mode
- ✓ Socket communication works correctly
- ✓ Echo tool responds with correct messages
- ✓ Clean termination works

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Reliability**: C components provide stable foundation
2. **No Singletons**: Eliminated Python import/module issues
3. **Socket Communication**: Tools can run detached and still communicate
4. **Message Queues**: Non-blocking CI-CI communication ready
5. **Filesystem Tracking**: Simple, reliable process management

## Next Steps

The infrastructure is ready for:
- Integrating real CI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue)
- Implementing the full message queue system
- Replacing next/staged-context-prompts with message queues
- Building the socket bridge for tool communication
